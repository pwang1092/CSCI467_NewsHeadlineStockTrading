Value stocks have been out of favor for the last few years, but value investor John Bailer, Newton Investment Management Deputy Head of Equity Income and Portfolio Manager, thinks that is going to change. Bailer believes that the decade following the 2008 financial crisis was an \"anomaly\" rather than the norm given how low rates had to be to spur economic growth. He says that rates have tended to skew, historically, to 4%-5% and, in that environment, value stocks tend to be what works. \"I do think that, for lots of reasons, we're going to have a little more inflation, a little higher interest rates. Money isn't going to be free any longer. And value will come back into favor,\" Bailer claims. Watch the video above to hear why Bailer says JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is a value stock to consider.

As Nvidia (NVDA) is set to report its earnings this week, HSBC Global Private Banking and Wealth Management Americas CIO Jose Rasco joins the show to discuss how the chip company and the overall AI push may impact the market (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC). He explains that new technology, like artificial intelligence, is diffusing across all sectors as companies seek to find efficiencies and expand revenue. Rasco adds that Nvidia and the AI boom will ultimately drive deflation in the market, ultimately resulting in lower prices for goods and services. However, there are some geopolitical pressures facing the chip sector. ASML (ASML) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) could disable their chip machines remotely if China were to invade Taiwan, according to a report from Bloomberg. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon sparked speculation about his potential resignation after pivoting from his usual stance during the company's annual investor day and saying that his remaining time at the company is no longer five years. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith explains what this means for the company's future and who might be considered to succeed Dimon. Lowe's (LOW) topped Wall Street's first quarter earnings estimates, posting revenue of $21.36 billion and gains of $3.06 per share. While consumer spending remains low, CEO Marvin Ellison points to loyalty programs and online spending as areas offsetting pullback concerns. Meanwhile, Peloton (PTON) is having a more difficult time dealing with the consumer sales slump as the home fitness company announced it is starting the sale of a $1 billion loan offering. Wendy's (WEN) and (TGT) both announced new initiatives to draw consumers back to their stores, from a $3 breakfast value meal to price cuts on five thousand items.

        "summary": "Although JPMorgan Chase (JPM) was only formed in 2000, the bank has roots that date back to our Founding Fathers. Let's take a look at the banking giant's biggest moments with Beyond the Ticker. 1799 JPMorgan Chase's earliest predecessor institution, The Manhattan Company, was founded. Its founders included Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr. 1871 Drexel, Morgan & Co. was founded by investment banker J. Pierpont Morgan and Anthony Drexel. The firm was renamed J.P. Morgan & Co. in 1895. 1877 Chase National Bank was founded by John Thompson, who named the bank after Salmon P. Chase, Secretary of the Treasury under Abraham Lincoln. 1955 Chase National Bank merged with The Bank of The Manhattan Company to form Chase Manhattan Bank. 2000 J.P. Morgan & Co. Inc. merged with The Chase Manhattan Corporation to form J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. 2004 J.P. Morgan Chase merged with Bank One Corporation, retaining the name JPMorgan Chase & Co. 2006 CEO of Bank One Jamie Dimon became the COO of JPMorgan Chase, eventually taking over the role of JPMorgan Chase CEO in 2006. 2008 During the financial recession of 2008, Dimon and JPMorgan Chase helped stabilize the markets by acquiring failing firms Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual. 2023 On May 1, 2023, J.P. Morgan Chase acquired First Republic Bank (FRCB) in the second-largest bank failure behind Washington Mutual. 2024 JPMorgan Chase is currently the world's largest bank, with a market cap of over $570 billion. The company remains committed to its future, leaning into artificial intelligence with its AI Research program, as it looks to remain atop the financial industry in this new digital age. From tech giants to retail titans,\u00a0Beyond the Ticker\u00a0is a historical series that takes a deep dive into some of Wall Street's trending companies and how they transformed into the financial icons they are today.

GDS Wealth Management chief investment officer Glen Smith joins Market Domination to discuss the print and what it means for the Federal Reserve's next interest rate decision. \"I think the market is softening a bit as evidenced by the ten-year Treasury coming down, so I think there's going to be some opportunities here going forward in terms of volatility,\" Smith explains. As inflation continues to be a stressor, he recommends investing in equities as \"the best opportunity to beat that inflation number.\" He points to financials and energy as two attractive sectors in which to invest. When it comes to financials, Smith calls JPMorgan Chase (JPM) the \"best breed of bank,\" as the net interest margin is attractive and lending should pick up when rates fall. On the energy side, he highlights Halliburton (HAL) as a great investment opportunity despite its underperformance. He believes that investors should buy the dip as the company has strong financials and currently sits as one of the largest oil service providers in the world. As inflation continues to put pressure on the economy, Smith believes a rate cut could come in September. Until then, he believes \"this is a great time to look at your portfolio. Make sure you're diversified. A lot of allocations have kind of gotten out of whack with [the] 'Magnificent Seven,' everything going on. Make sure you're not over-concentrated in any one sector or stock that might be a little bit speculative at this point.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

Rockland Trust vice president and portfolio manager Michael Sayers and Halo Investing president & co-founder Jason Barsema join Market Domination to reflect on the state of the economy and discuss their top plays. \"I think investors should brace for volatility as we look to the summer,\" Barsema warns as earnings season has wrapped up. However, Sayers is less concerned: \"I think the economy has enough underlying momentum, and there's a lot of fiscal support from all the government spending such that we can make it through the end of the year without a significant deterioration in the economy.\" Barsema is bullish on utilities, believing they are a great defensive play if the economy continues to soften. On the offense, he points to the increased demand from the AI boom as a major source of growth. He also points to large banks as better positioned compared to smaller banks, which have a lot of commercial real estate amid a tight market. Sayers highlights industrial players like Honeywell (HON) as well-positioned to benefit from the \"industrial renaissance\" the US sees as supply chains move back on shore. The company has also rolled out an AI platform designed to deliver customer-specific insights that Sayers believes has much growth potential.

        "summary": "As the world\u2019s largest companies scramble to tackle the impacts of climate change, Big Tech is betting on a surprisingly low-tech solution to reach their net-zero goal. Enhanced rock weathering already happens naturally over thousands of years, but startup Lithos Carbon is accelerating the process, spreading leftover rock dust across farm fields. The company is scaling its operation with financial backing from Frontier, a consortium of investors that include Meta (META), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and JPMorgan (JPM). The climate fund, led by payments processing company Stripe, committed $57.1 million to Lithos Carbon last year to remove over 154,000 tons of carbon. Lithos Carbon is one of hundreds of startups globally that are competing in a carbon removal industry expected to reach $135 billion by 2040, according to consulting firm BCG. Once considered a workaround for critical emission-cutting work, carbon removal technologies, which extract and sequester carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere, are increasingly seen as a necessary step to capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2050, as laid out in the Paris Agreement. The UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said the world needs to remove up to 10 billion tons of carbon per year by the middle of the century to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Roughly 2,400 companies have disclosed having net-zero targets in place, according to nonprofit group CDP. Many of those firms are turning to carbon removal technologies to offset emissions, as they realize that emissions reductions alone won\u2019t get them within their net-zero goals. Demand for carbon credits is projected to quadruple from 2030 to 2040, according to BCG. Big Tech firms are among the biggest buyers of carbon removal credits. Microsoft (MSFT), the leading buyer globally, has purchased more than 7.6 million carbon credits, since 2020 according to online tracker CDR.fyi.

        "summary": "During Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's latest press conference, he was bullish on the banking industry despite the prevailing high interest rate environment. To discuss their outlook on the banking sector, Zacks Investment Management Client Portfolio Manager Brian Mulberry and Whalen Global Advisors Chairman Chris Whalen join Market Domination. Mulberry notes that there hasn't been \"another wave of bank failures,\" attributing previous failures to poor management and \"overexposure to bad assets.\" However, he acknowledges that banks have rebounded, gained more liquidity, and strengthened their structures. Looking ahead, Mulberry emphasizes that quality and scale \"will matter the most\" for banks moving forward. On the other hand, Whalen advises looking at \"the banks that actually perform well.\" Whalen expresses skepticism about the commercial banking sector's ability to achieve a soft landing scenario under the current high interest rate environment, citing \"a horrific destruction of value.\" However, he suggests that the consumer side of banking remains relatively resilient.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) Carla Hassan joins Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi and Rachelle Akuffo to discuss current trends in wealth management. Hassan highlights the diverse spectrum of investors, ranging from established individuals to those just beginning their wealth-building journey. She emphasizes that JPMorgan's business strategy focuses on \"how [do] we segment who those customers are and how [do] we talk to them?\" The company aims to create tailored products for each individual based on their unique approach to building wealth. \"You can't think about the wealth continuum as just one customer, you have to think about the different phases of their life,\" Hassan stresses. Addressing generational differences in wealth building, Hassan notes an older, established generation who \"understand good financial acumen.\" In contrast, she points out \"an entire generation that frankly, when you think about all the misinformation that is out there in the marketplace,\" requires a different approach. JPMorgan aims to position itself as a trusted financial institution that informs and enables this younger generation to make practical decisions regarding their wealth and future. Addressing the evolving digital media landscape and the increasing trend of consumers seeking financial information online, Hassan emphasizes JPMorgan's role as a trustworthy institution. She tells Yahoo Finance, \"It's across the board how people are consuming information and getting information, so for us we think it's a huge opportunity, as a trusted brand, to be able to say here's years and years and years of getting it right.

As far as the consumer impact on bank earnings, Goldberg notes that while lower-end consumers continue to face financial pressures, this demographic's struggles may not significantly impact overall bank earnings. \"It's just not a huge contributor to revenues,\" Goldberg explains, though he adds that \"it's certainly something to be mindful of.\" A trend Goldberg identifies in the bank earnings is a strong performance in their trading and investment banking divisions. He predicts that institutions with a focus in these areas, such as Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS), may benefit from this trend in upcoming earnings releases next week. However, Goldberg also points out a potential area of concern: \"loan growth continues to be subdued.\" This trend, he believes, will impact regional banks earnings.

Sykes expresses a bullish stance on bank earnings, highlighting two key factors that could potentially boost reports. First, he notes that the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 5% increase for the quarter could positively impact asset and wealth management segments in bank earnings. Secondly, Sykes points to \"a slight decline\" in the ten-year yield, which he views as beneficial for operating capital contribution. Overall, Sykes sees \"continued steady progress\" in the banking sector, asserting that \"fundamentally, they're chugging along and in good shape.\" Regarding consumer trends supporting big banks, Sykes acknowledges a slowdown among lower-income consumers due to inflation pressures. However, he emphasizes that \"we continue to see pretty strong metrics out of the higher-end\" consumers.

And so Goldman is a good momentum play, but we argue that their earnings stream remains much more cyclical than the market is valuing them at,\" Peabody states. \"And that's the big debate out there in management as they moved away from their failed consumer banking strategy back to their roots as an investment bank, have been trying to convince the street that there is a core underlying earnings power that's sustainable and stable. And I don't believe them.\" Peabody also looks ahead to the bank earnings due out this week, such as Morgan Stanley (MS): \"I think it's going to be more of the same \u2014 strong, investment banking with an eye towards a pick up in M&A and IPOs in the second half of the year.

Mendon Capital senior portfolio manager Anton Schutz and Janney Montgomery Scott director of research Chris Marinac joined to discuss recent weakness in JPMorgan (JPM) and Ally Financial (ALLY) stocks as well as expected mergers and acquisition (M&A) activity in the sector. After JPMorgan warned about its net interest income, the stock fell, though Schutz said investors' worries were overblown. The portfolio manager expects the company to beat its guidance given its \"priced for greatness.\" Marinac told the Market Domination team that another factor for JPMorgan investors is the timing of upcoming rate cuts. Ahead of expected rate cuts, the banking sector is \u201cpositioned very well because the cost of funds surged during the last 12 to 18 months, and so as interest rates fall, the cost of funds is going to improve.\u201d After comments from the Ally CFO on Tuesday raised concerns about credit quality, Schutz said this dynamic reflects the company's customer base rather than cause for concern about the banking market at large. \u201cAlly's just seeing the pressure\u201d from having a customer base of \u201csubprime consumers,\u201d Schutz said. Schutz did note that credit quality is important given that banks' book values, a company\u2019s assets versus liabilities, are \u201ccritical\u201d as mergers and acquisitions (M&A) are expected \u201cto pick up meaningfully.\u201d Marinac added that the expected uptick in M&A deals could come from mid-cap banks consolidating and acquiring regional banks to scale. \u201cWe absolutely are at an inflection point on M&A,\u201d and \u201cthe question is how much happens now and how much happens in the next six months,\u201d Marinac said, highlighting that \u201cthe stocks haven't yet discounted that positive news,\u201d leaving an opportunity for investors. Schutz named First Horizon (FHN) and Veritex (VBTX) among his top picks, while Marinac called out Ameris Bancorp (ABCB), FB Financial (FBK), and Fifth Third (FITB).

KBW managing director David Konrad joins Asking for a Trend to discuss the state of the sector and break down the Fed's latest move. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) President and COO Daniel Pinto believes that analysts may have too rosy of expectations for the bank's net interest income expenses in 2025. Konrad notes that his estimate is below Wall Street's own guidance, and adds, \"What happened this past year is their guidance kept being raised because they're asset sensitive, the forward curve didn't materialize, and the Fed really didn't cut rates yet obviously this year. So their estimates this year beat expectations.\" As the Federal Reserve moves into an interest rate easing cycle, Konrad expects \"asset-sensitive\" names like JPMorgan to experience some pressure in its net interest income. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs (GS) announced that trading revenue could fall 10% in the third quarter, which Konrad calls \"disappointing.\" He notes that trading will be a more volatile number as it faces seasonality and volume issues. He adds, \"We think that's that's a little bit not necessarily a trend line, but a tough quarter there.\" With the Fed unveiling new proposed capital requirements, Konrad argues that \"reducing the capital requirements by 50% was kind of in the market a little bit. And that's really basically where it came into.\" Fed Vice Chair of Supervision Barr expects capital to rise about 9%, which Konrad says \"feels about right\" and comes in \"largely in-line\" with expectations: \"The Fed typically gold plates the international standards, and then they took it a step further with this proposal. So what ended up happening is you had the US banks holding a lot more capital than the global banks. And so I think this largely adjusts that.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Asking for a Trend. This post was written by Melanie Riehl",

Fundstrat Global Advisors managing director and global head of technical strategy Mark Newton joins Market Domination to discuss market trends and how investors should prepare for the year-end. Big Bank stocks, in particular, are under pressure after the Federal Reserve proposed new capital requirement regulations for banks that would seek easements on their capital holdings while scaling back other requirements. Newtown notes that financials (XLF) are the second-largest sector in the S&P 500 after technology (XLK), and that today's movement is \"a minor pullback.\" He highlights that banks have been up about 10% over the last three months, and the pullback is \"on the heels of really robust gains in this sector.\" Newton finds the broader market picture to be \"pretty healthy,\" pointing to new all-time highs in technology, financials, healthcare (XLV), industrials (XLI), and utilities (XLU). While the tech sector is under pressure, he believes that it has \"not broken down substantially enough to think that tech is broken.\" \"We have this huge amount of contentiousness and divisiveness regarding the election. Of course, two wars overseas. A lot to get us unhappy about. Earnings, though, have been remarkably good, and the stock market itself has been good,\" Newton tells Yahoo Finance. \"So, you know, let's not get too bent out of shape about, granted, some understandable major pullback in some of the semiconductor stocks. I don't think it's been damaging enough to say that the market has peaked out honestly. But it is an uncomfortable time for many investors.\" Wall Street is also paying extra close attention to the Federal Reserve as it moves forward with its first interest rate cut, and Newtown anticipates an interest rate cut of 35 basis points. He notes that when the Fed has cut between 25 and 50 basis points historically, it's been \"troublesome.\" \"My thinking is the market ends the year probably at 5,800 or higher, and the best times of any election year typically tend to be buying weakness into the election November into next spring really should be the sweet spot for investors. So if you want to make money in this day and age, you know, in this time period between now and the election, you have to be very well diversified,\" Newton says. He recommends the healthcare sector and financials, calling JPMorgan Chase & Co's (JPM) stock price \u2014 currently around $200 per share \u2014 a \"steal.\" He also stresses the importance of being diversified, especially as a broad-based recovery lies for the market after the election.

        "summary": "Federal Reserve official Michael Barr has unveiled new regulatory proposals targeting US banks. The changes would require the country's biggest banks to boost their capital reserves by an aggregate of 9%. To discuss the implications of these proposals, Catalysts welcomes Chairman of Whalen Global Advisors Chris Whalen. Whalen argues that the focus of this regulatory effort should have been on market risks rather than capital. He points out that since the Supreme Court overturned the \"Chevron deference\" doctrine, which previously gave regulatory agencies the benefit of the doubt when interpreting ambiguous laws, federal regulators are now more \"vulnerable to losing in court\" if banks choose to challenge their decisions legally. \"The large banks are not happy seeing a 25% increase in capital [reserves] because they don't need it. These banks are giving back capital to investors every quarter. In fact, they would like to give back more. The banks are under-levered in terms of opportunity,\" Whalen tells Yahoo Finance. He adds, \"So I think that the regulators are still not looking forward to future risks, they're looking behind.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.

While these banks outperformed expectations, the potential impact of future Federal Reserve rate cuts on these financial giants remains a key concern. Hennessy Funds portfolio manager David Ellison, joins Market Domination to share his outlook on the situation. Ellison notes that, fundamentally, bank earnings aligned with investor expectations. However, he emphasizes a significant shift: \"The mathematics of the business is working in their favor for the first time in a while,\" as banks grow equity, buy back stocks, and see tangible book values increase. Furthermore, he points out that as banks like JPMorgan see their balance sheets expand, \"the banks are becoming a much bigger part of how the Fed is going to fund the government,\" which creates additional value for these major financial institutions. \"Those are the things that I see: the Fed is shrinking, the banks are getting bigger, and because of that, they're becoming more important and more profitable,\" Ellison tells Yahoo Finance.

Whalen says the net interest income \u201cis an illustration of the fact that JP is well managed. Jamie Dimon has managed to his duration, if you will, much better than the other large banks.

Even though JP has built reserves, [and] reserves are up over 100% year over year, they're still not at a level where you're going to be terribly worried,\u201d he says. \u201cOverall, JP is going to lead the pack back up as the large caps come back into favor with the managers,\u201d Whalen says, noting that in the second quarter, \u201csmaller names American Express, Axos, [and] Ameriprise, they all rose to the top\u2026 I think managers liked the large caps in the first quarter [and] certainly last year, but now, not so much.\u201d He adds the big risk to the banking sectors \u201cis if we don't get more rate cuts from the Fed, which I think is a likely scenario.\u201d To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here.

        "summary": "Big banks will kick off the third quarter earnings season as JPMorgan (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and BlackRock (BLK) are all expected to report earnings on Friday. Gabelli Funds portfolio manager Macrae Sykes joins Catalysts to break down what investors can expect from the bank earnings ahead and how major firms will be impacted by the Federal Reserve's rate-easing cycle. \"I think it should be a pretty good earnings season. We do know that there's going to be some headwinds from NII (net interest income) that's shifting around a little bit. But the S&P financials (^SPSDMUN) is up about 10% for the quarter, so good anticipation of the results. You have the S&P up 6% during the quarter. That's good for wealth and asset management contribution in terms of fee revenue. Deposits up 1%, 4% annualized, so that's supportive of balance sheets. NIMS (net interest margin security), we had this surprise 50-basis-point cut versus 25 in the quarter. That's not really going to be impactful but that gives a good setup for going forward in terms of the net interest margins normalizing and getting better going into '25, '26,\" Sykes tells Yahoo Finance. Thus, he believes that while these earnings will be good for banks, investors will be looking for better acceleration over the next few years as both the consumer and credit are performing well. As the Federal Reserve continues to ease interest rates, Sykes explains that banks that are asset-sensitive, like JPMorgan, will face some pressure when it comes to their balance sheets. While the size and pacing of the Fed's next steps are unknown, Sykes explains, \"I think the banks will react accordingly and that will be a good environment.\" He continues, \"And then we've seen the rate curve in general flatten out, so stop the inversion. And I think that's a good path to recovery in terms of managing your liabilities and assets.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts here.

Citizens JMP director of financial technology research Devin Ryan joins Market Domination to break down what investors can expect from these earnings and his top plays in the sector. After the Federal Reserve delivered a 50-basis-point cut in September, Ryan explains, \"What you earn on your cash on the asset side of the equation is going to come down a little bit. But the flip side is the deposit costs are going to come down as well.\" Thus, he points to names like Charles Schwab (SCHW) that are in a position to benefit after underperforming in the last year. \"Even though on one hand, they are going to see a little bit of a lower asset yield on some of their short-term stuff, the longer-term securities are rolling off and they're going to reprice higher,\" Ryan tells Yahoo Finance. He adds, \"And then they have this funding cost dynamic where customer, essentially cash deposits, have been going out the door to money markets. And I think that's going to stop as well.\" In addition, Ryan notes that capital markets have been \"very depressed.\" As interest rates continue to fall, companies will likely decrease their financing, and in turn, financials could see a rise in M&A (mergers and acquisitions) activity. He also points to Goldman Sachs (GS) as another great opportunity, as he is bullish on its alternative asset management business. \"The alternative asset managers trade at 25 times or more on forward earnings. So as that part of their business becomes more meaningful, that's going to move the needle,\" Ryan argues. Ryan highlights Perella Weinberg (PWP) as a small-cap play in the sector. He explains, \"It's a small advisory boutique trading at 13 times our estimate for next year. The peers are over 20 times. So I think they're going to close that valuation gap, so there's a lot of upside still there.\" Watch the video above to hear what Ryan thinks is in store for LPL Financial (LPLA) as it grapples with a leadership shakeup.

Biggar says the Federal Reserve rate easing cycle benefits the banking sector alongside the rest of the market. \u201cAs bank analysts, we typically root for higher interest rates because that's better for net interest margins. But there has been a point where these high rates have kind of worn out their welcome.\u201d \u201cLower rates here will help stimulate some of the loan growth, which has been very, very weak. That will help take some of the pressure off deposit costs, which have also been elevated for banks. And then also [it] kind of helps with increasing the odds of a soft landing, and that will help with loss provision. So you know that slower economy has produced higher unemployment here to the extent we can take some of that pressure off, we get lower loss provision. So really a triple boom for the for the lending business, if lower rates pan out.\u201d Following last week\u2019s better-than-expected September jobs report, the market may be wary that the Fed may put a pause on cutting rates. Biggar says, \u201cWe have been counting on lower rates and, of course, that is a double-edged sword and... hurts on the net interest margin front. But, you know, to the extent that the banks are pretty well hedged here, [assuming] the economy doesn't fall off a cliff.\u201d He adds, \u201cBanks are pretty well hedged. And they'll do okay. Loan growth has not turned negative loss provisions have not. You know increased to the point that it's really hurting profitability at this stage. And then you've got the capital markets side which is showing some signs of rebound. So I think you know, all told, the next six months [are] probably better than the last six for banks.\u201d Biggar names JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley (MS) as top stock picks in the banking sector going into earnings season.

This earnings cycle has noted a rebound in dealmaking activity from top investment banks, particularly in Morgan Stanley's bond underwriting and M&A advisory units. \"The dealmaking pipeline that's been announced over the last quarter's earnings release is a great sign for all of the sectors. But in particular for banking, you have a lot of pent-up demand for deals, as we saw a dearth of transactions in 2023,\" PwC US banking & capital markets deals leader Dan Goerlich tells Yahoo Finance. \"And as we move into 2024, a lot of the banks are undertaking initiatives to look at growth across the spectrum, but in particular in organic growth through deals.\" Goerlich expands upon his outlook for M&A activity and what it means for larger and regional banks, and how their priorities may differ: \"You have mega banks that are looking at a wide variety of different initiatives that might be product offerings, technology, new plays in fintech, and other businesses like asset and wealth and broker dealers. And then when you get into the regionals, it's a more traditional banking environment where growth might come from bolting on a more traditional merger where you have upscale in leverage and scale, but you also have new products and offerings that might come from that tie up.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts\u00a0here.

The financial giant posted impressive results, with net profits surging 32% compared to the same period last year. Bloomberg Intelligence director of research Alison Williams analyzes the bank's performance on Morning Brief. Williams highlights that Morgan Stanley \"executed in a very strong environment,\" noting a significant rebound in wealth management flows. After a relatively weak second quarter, these flows reached $64 billion in Q3, which she says \"really exemplifies the health of the business.\" A particular bright spot for the bank was its equity trading division. While all global investment banks showed strength in this area during the quarter, Williams emphasized that Morgan Stanley was \"the standout.\" She also discusses the bank's significant transformation under former CEO James Gorman's leadership: \"Of all the banks, Morgan Stanley has been the one that had the biggest change in its model over the last decade or so, and that was really through a series of acquisitions under Gorman. Gorman did set out a series of very aggressive targets for the business that Ted Pick is now taking over and having to deliver on, but certainly in this quarter he is delivering it.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief\u00a0here.

American Banker editor-in-chief Chana Schoenberger joins Catalysts to discuss Big Bank earnings and her major takeaways from the industry. Schoenberger's biggest takeaway from bank earnings is that \"investment banking is up and trading is up.\" She attributes this trend to two factors: the markets being up and an increase in dealmaking. She notes that M&A (mergers and acquisitions) activity has increased this year and will continue its momentum as interest rates fall. While easing interest rates is usually bad news for banks, she notes that it's not all negative: \"When deposits come, in they have to pay money. They have to pay interest to their depositors. But then they also get to keep that spread. So a low [interest] rate environment should generally mean that things pick up in the economy and that is very good for banks.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts here.

As financial institutions adjust to the new interest rate environment, Leon forecasts M&A underwriting transactions. He found Citi's earnings performance to be \"a little sluggish.\" CFRA has Citi at a Buy rating with a $73 per share price target. \"The intermediate of course, is a streamlined bank, one that's watching expenses. It's rid itself of consumer banks outside the US, and it has still a pretty significant institutional treasury service business,\" Leon tells Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton. \"It wasn't good enough today, and I think part of this was the messaging from senior management that still talks about a multiyear transformation.\" Leon also weighs in on Bank of America's net interest income and looks ahead to what to expect from Morgan Stanley (MS) when it reports earnings Wednesday morning.

And do we start to see growth again in net interest income next year? That's a critical question because if you do start to see net interest income growing, which is the biggest revenue component of banks, you start to get an outlook that allows banks to post positive operating leverage and improving EPS momentum and ROTC momentum,\u201d Martinez tells Yahoo Finance. \u201cIn the case of Bank of America, especially tomorrow, that's a key driver. What they say about net interest income in the fourth quarter and into 2025, and whether they continue to see that improving in 2025 is going to be a really important determinant for how the share price reacts.\u201d Given JPMorgan\u2019s strong investment banking results reported last week, Martinez says he\u2019s cautiously optimistic about Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs's upcoming reports. He explains, \u201cWe favor investment banks over traditional banks.\u201d \u201cWe think the earnings revision cycle, which has been negative for a few years, is inflecting. We think [in] the wealth management business there\u2019s some positive signs there in terms of net new fee-generating assets. But the investment banking side is a big piece of that as well. We think they are positively leveraged [for an] improving investment banking cycle. We still think we\u2019re in the middle innings of that improvement, and that could last a couple of years.\u201d Martinez names Goldman and Morgan Stanley as \u201cprimary beneficiaries.\u201d Ahead of Citi\u2019s quarterly results, Martinez says he\u2019ll be watching for \u201cdynamics that point to a better profitability outlook over the next couple of years,\u201d especially given \u201cthere's a lot of stuff that is in their control expenses.\u201d To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination here.

Krugman acknowledges Dimon as a \"great businessman\" but expresses skepticism about his potential effectiveness as Treasury Secretary, emphasizing that the role \"requires a quite different set of skills.\" \"This is a repeated delusion,\" Krugman says, \"we tend to assume that if you make a lot of money you can be great at other things and that is clearly just not the case.\" Earlier this week, billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban told Yahoo Finance that he believes Dimon would \"do an amazing job\" as a potential Treasury Secretary.

The people at the top tend to be more Republican and for whatever reason seem to be supporting Donald Trump,\" Bill Cohan tells Yahoo Finance on Catalysts. He adds, \"Jamie Dimon has sort of played it down the middle,\" noting the CEO's balanced approach to both campaigns throughout the election period. Regarding Dimon's potential influence on voters' support for Harris, Cohan expresses skepticism: \"I wish Jamie Dimon could sway undecided voters at this point to back Kamala Harris. I just don't believe there's any undecided voters anymore. I don't even know what an undecided voter would look like at this point, let alone one on Wall Street. I don't know that anybody can sway anybody at this point,\" adding that both sides have seen significant \"fascinating endorsements.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts\u00a0here.

KBW managing director David Konrad joins Josh Lipton on Asking for a Trend to discuss why Trump's win sent the sector higher and what bank investors are looking for from his second term. Konrad says, \"There's three main factors, all kind of surrounding deregulation to some extent,\" that sent bank stocks higher: less antitrust regulation leading to more mergers, lower capital constraints, and less pressure from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) on consumer fees. \"The other factor would be a little bit of the concern of the inflationary ramifications of the Trump administration, potentially, and so people are looking for more asset-sensitive names for kind of a higher for longer, and those are really the true outperformers that we saw today.\" Watch the video above for more about Konrad's expectations for the banking sector under Trump.

Mulberry notes this makes it difficult to justify the S&P 500's current valuation levels. Looking ahead to 2025's expected pro-growth agenda under Trump, Mulberry cautions investors about market transitions. \"Simply what we're saying is we're at a moment of inflection as we change administrations and different policies come into play. You're really going to want to know what you own and know why you own it.\" For investment strategy, Mulberry recommends focusing on sectors with \"real durable earnings structures\" like financials and utilities, which he believes offer better growth potential and stability compared to the broader market. He highlights JPMorgan (JPM) in specific saying \"on a relative valuation basis [its] a very good growth name.\" Watch the video above to hear Mulberry's view on the growing AI trade.

As it grew as a much larger component of major indices, we saw sentiment reached to extremes in a way that we just haven't seen in the past,\" Buchanan says, noting that \"A lot of that [growth] was largely the AI trade [and] kind of tech-oriented.\" The portfolio manager says, \"We've been moving to a more balanced approach here over the last couple of months. Not necessarily selling or going short [on] tech in any possible way, [but rebalancing].\" Within the financials sector, he says, \"We absolutely have a preference towards some of the larger money center banks. We have positions in Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan (JPM), Citigroup (C), just to name a few,\" Buchanan says, explaining that the large financial institutions stand to benefit from macroeconomic conditions with loan growth and profitability expected to improve as \"economic activity and transactions continue to accelerate.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Wealth here.

        "summary": "The financial sector (XLF) is readying itself for an eventful 2025, with many on Wall Street expecting an uptick in dealmaking amid possible deregulations under the second Trump administration. Whalen Global Advisors Chairman Chris Whalen sits down with Seana Smith and Madison Mills on Catalysts to talk more about the financial sector. Whalen Global Advisors LLC manages several indexes tracking bank stocks and the financial sector: the WGA Bank Top 10 Index (WBXSW), WGA Bank Top 25 Index (WBXXVW), WGA Bank Top 50 Index (WBLW).  \"We like to focus on quality and performance. So I think for the better performers in the group, you could see more expansion, frankly. American Express (AXP) could probably flirt with six times book value next year unless we see a negative come around,\" Whalen tells Yahoo Finance. \"But, you know, I don't see that right now. If anything, you know, we've had three quarters where the banks have moved very much.\"  Whalen goes on to call commercial real estate one of the \"only pain point[s]\" for the industry, but warning: \"Banks that don't have a lot of consumer or commercial exposures are going to be fine. Banks that specialize in commercial real estate or have historically specialized in multifamily in some of the blue states, some of the larger cities are going to be taking pain.\"  To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts\u00a0here.
