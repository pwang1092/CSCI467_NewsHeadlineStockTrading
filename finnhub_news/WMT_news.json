Jaggi emphasizes the remarkable resilience of US consumer spending. \"I think it really says a lot about the fact that, at the end of the day, this consumer economy keeps finding ways to engage with the consumer,\" he observes. However, Jaggi points out a shift in shopping patterns: \"We have become a value-oriented consumer society.\" Retailers like Ross (ROST), Walmart (WMT), and Target (TGT) are experiencing consistent foot traffic as shoppers seek bargains. This value-hunting extends online, with Jaggi noting that \"the US consumer continues to find ways to find the best bang for the dollar.\" Looking ahead to 2025, Jaggi expresses optimism about the department store sector. He views Nordstrom's (JWN) announcement to go private as \"great news,\" describing the retailer as \"the gold standard\" and suggesting the move will enable better focus on long-term growth strategies. \"Retail requires a long-term mindset,\" he tells Yahoo Finance. \"It does not require a quarter-to-quarter mindset only.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts\u00a0here.

Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi spoke with CEO Doug McMillon about how the retailer's big investments have been paying off, while CFO John David Rainey explained that the company's recent success didn't happen by accident. Yahoo Finance's Surprise of the Year was General Motors (GM). CEO Mary Barra credits the automaker's diverse portfolio for its big success. Bank of America auto analyst John Murphy also weighed in to give his take on what could be next for the stock. Nvidia's (NVDA) AI-focused Blackwell platform was named Product of the Year. Comeback of the Year went to Robinhood (HOOD). Its stock has surged and it made big headway in diversifying its product offerings. CEO Vlad Tenev discusses what's next for the company while Mizuho senior analyst Dan Dolev argues Robinhood is a stock to own under the incoming Trump administration.

Dowlatshahi traces the evolution of DEI initiatives following the death of George Floyd in 2020, highlighting how companies initially took \"a strong stance supporting under-represented communities.\" However, he points out the political and social climate has shifted since then, with \"the fall and the rise again of the Trump administration, conservative movement, and far-right movement in the United States, and the 'anti-woke' movements again. And because of that, you see now companies catering to those populations,\" pointing to businesses like Walmart and Lowe's (LOW). Despite these shifts, Dowlatshahi asserts that \"discrimination is still discrimination.\" The attorney remains hopeful that established state and federal laws will continue to protect against workplace discrimination. Although, he acknowledges a concerning trend, telling Yahoo Finance \"I have seen an increase in fear, frankly.\" \"The hope is that we can stand on state and federal law that has been in place for decades and decades,\" the MSD partner concludes.

        "summary": "Walmart has been named Yahoo Finance's 2024 Company of the Year. Its stock is up nearly 80% year to date, and sales are booming. Why? In an exclusive interview with Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon explains how pre-pandemic investments are starting to pay off. \"We invested in wages for our associates. We invested in our people, things like education. We invested in lower prices, we invested in e-commerce, we invested in technology, all within a pretty tight period of time,\" he said. One thing that's helping to boost the bottom line is the type of customer Walmart (WMT) is drawing in. The company says it is increasingly attracting more higher-income consumers. McMillon thinks that convenience has been drawing a different customer base. He also discusses inflation, noting that the prices for general merchandise are falling faster than food items. A top-of-mind topic for many CEOs right now is the threat of a trade war, with President-elect Trump threatening to enact more tariffs. McMillon thinks Walmart is \"positioned to manage\" tariffs but worries that customers may see higher prices, even though the retail giant plans to \"do everything we can to try and keep them low.\" There's one technology McMillon is excited about \u2014 generative AI. \"It's going to help us be more anticipatory for customers and members ... The world will look more like personal shopping assistance than it will an old-fashioned search bar with a laundry list of results that you and I then have to work through as a customer. Just saving us time, making it more convenient, helping us solve problems,\" McMillon said of the tech. Watch the video above to hear what McMillon expects for Walmart over the next 10 years.

Catalysts Co-Hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills sit down with former Attorney General at the Antitrust Division of the US Department of Justice (DOJ) Bill Baer to examine the latest news about the failed merger just ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's second term in office. \"The parties have a right to appeal, but you have two courts who ruled yesterday, one in Washington \u2014 a state court \u2014 and then a federal judge in Oregon, and they basically, in very detailed opinions, said the same things,\" Baer, who is also the former director of the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) Bureau of Competition, says. \"Kroger and Albertsons are each other's closest competitors in many markets all across the country, and because they're closest competitors, if Kroger is allowed to absorb Albertsons in its various brands, it will have extra pricing muscle [and] it will be able to raise prices,\" he says, adding that \"they compete directly with one another,\" rather than Costco (COST) or Walmart (WMT) the judge found.
