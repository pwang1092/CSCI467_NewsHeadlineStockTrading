Beyond the Ticker\u00a0takes a deep dive into the company\u2019s biggest moments. 1962 Walmart was founded by Sam Walton. Its first location was in Rogers, Arkansas. 1967 The Walton family owned 24 stores and had racked up $12.7 million in sales. 1970 On October 1, 1970, Walmart went public via an IPO on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares opened at $16.50 per share. 1983 The company opened its first Sam's Club in Oklahoma in a bid to compete with Costco\u2019s (COST) wholesale, member-only model. 1988 Founder Sam Walton stepped down as CEO, and David Glass was named his successor. That same year, the first Walmart Supercenter opened in Washington, Missouri, creating what it\u2019s currently known for \u2013 a mix of general merchandise and grocery. 1996 Walmart opened its first location in China and surpassed $1 billion in sales for the year. 2000 Walmart.com launched, allowing US customers to shop online \u2013 as Amazon.com (AMZN) began to take off. 2017 To compete with Amazon, among other online retailers, Walmart introduced free two-day shipping. 2020-2021 During the pandemic, the retailer boomed as consumers sought out the Covid-19 vaccine, and then, cheaper groceries as inflation picked up. 2024 In late March, Walmart stock reached a record closing high of $61.45 per share. And it only keeps growing \u2013 with more than 10,500 stores in 19 different countries. From tech giants to retail titans,\u00a0Beyond the Ticker\u00a0is a historical series that takes a deep dive into some of Wall Street's trending companies and how they transformed into the financial icons they are today.

        "summary": "Consumer confidence has hit its lowest level since July 2022, as inflation remains high and spending slows down. Morningstar Equity Analyst David Swartz and Jefferies Senior Vice President of Equity Research Corey Tarlowe join Market Domination to break down what this news means for retailers. Tarlowe explains that consumers are willing to spend, but are increasingly cutting down in certain areas. This bodes well for value-conscious brands like Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT), as consumers will likely choose generic grocery products over more expensive private-label brands. Swartz tells Yahoo Finance's Akiko Fujita and Josh Lipton that when it comes to apparel, the issues are often company-specific, rather than reflective of the economy. He points to Ralph Lauren (RL) as an example of a specialized brand that understands its consumers, which is ultimately reflected in its high stock price. On the other hand, department store Nordstrom (JWN) has been struggling since the pandemic and its inability to recover may lead to the company potentially being taken private.

TD Cowen Senior Research Analyst Oliver Chen joins The Morning Brief to break down the retail giant's performance as consumer wallets tighten amid sticky inflation. Chen calls Walmart a \"top pick,\" saying it offers \"both needs and wants\" of the consumer. He says the grocery business remains critical to Walmart, accounting for over 50% of its revenue. However, the company also offers great value for bigger ticket items. He points to the Walmart+ membership program as an area gaining momentum, offering customers free shipping and savings on gas, among other perks. While Target (TGT) has been pushing higher-end apparel, like its collaboration with Diane von Furstenberg, Chen says that Walmart \"does a great job\" with staples like underwear and basic apparel. \"The opportunity is for Walmart to be more like a lifestyle brand and apparel, and expand into dresses, amplify their presence in denim, and trade the customer up,\" he explains. He adds that the company has already started to remodel stores and add more private-label brands to appeal to higher-end consumers. \"We also see what we say is 'customized moderation,' meaning customers are both scrambling and splurging, trading up and trading down...Everybody wants to look good and fashionable, and you can do that at a very good price,\" he says.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) closed above 5,300 for the first time ever following the release of April's Consumer Price Index inflation print. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) both also closed higher. Investors are bullish after BMO Capital Markets raised its year-end target for the S&P 500 to 5600, the current highest target on Wall Street. Yahoo Finance Reporter Josh Schafer joins Market Domination Overtime to analyze whether the market can continue its momentum. CEO of Brazil-based Nubank (NU) David V\u00e9lez joins the show to break down the company's earnings which topped the Street's expectations. Nu Holdings is looking to expand its business beyond Brazil, seeing Mexico as a \"phenomenal opportunity\" due to its large market size. Cisco (CSCO) posted its third quarter earnings after the market close. The company reported adjusted earnings of $0.88 per share, which beat the estimated $0.82, and revenue of $12.70 billion, which was slightly better than estimates. The tech giant also raised its full-year guidance. Morningstar Equity Analyst William Kerwin says the demand slumps for Cisco up until now were a symptom of the \"COVID hangover,\" and it may take another quarter for demand to stabilize fully. Finally, Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton break down what to watch on Thursday, from new housing data to Walmart (WMT) earnings to remarks from Federal Reserve officials.

Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma breaks down earnings expectations and four key areas investors should watch closely. The retail giant is expected to report $159.5 billion in earnings and adjusted earnings per share of $0.53. US same-store sales are estimated to rise by 3.42%, boosted by increased foot traffic and ticket size. DiPalma says she will be watching to see if Walmart continues to hold on to the grocery share gains it made during the pandemic. She is also looking for insight on its new private label brand, Better Goods, which will come at a higher quality and price. Last year, Walmart announced $9 billion in store renovations, and DiPalma hopes to see how the updated stores are performing. Finally, she says she has her eyes on Walmart's e-commerce business as it seeks to compete with the likes of Amazon (AMZN).

Stocks (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) opened relatively flat on Tuesday morning following hotter-than-expected Producer Price Index (PPI) inflation data for April. Jefferies Senior US Economist Thomas Simons joins the show to break down the PPI print and what it signals for the Federal Reserve, believing there is a chance interest rate cuts may not happen this year at all. Meanwhile, President Biden is set to unveil a new wave of tariffs on Chinese imports, including electric vehicles, semiconductors, and precious minerals. Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger analyzes the sectors most likely to be impacted. Meme stocks like GameStop (GME) continue to soar in a second-day rally following the online return of user \"Roaring Kitty\" on X (formerly Twitter), who was largely responsible for the 2021 GameStop short squeeze. However, the retail sector is under pressure, as Walmart (WMT) is reportedly preparing to lay off hundreds of corporate workers and Home Depot (HD) posted first-quarter earnings that fell below Wall Street estimates, signaling a pullback on consumer spending. Shares of Alibaba (BABA) also sunk after the company posted an 86% loss in profit year-over-year.  Tesla (TSLA) is backpedaling its recent decision to lay off most of its Supercharger team, as Bloomberg reports the electric vehicle giant is preparing to rehire some of them. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) is expected to unveil new artificial intelligence initiatives in its Google I/O developer conference today. This post was written by Melanie Riehl",

        "summary": "It looks like the tables have turned, as Walmart (WMT) is set to usurp Target (TGT) as America's favorite big-box retailer. This Wednesday, May 22nd, Target debuted less than stellar Q1 Earnings report, Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma explains: \"It's really the tale of two retailers...Target falling 3.7 percent. Just last week, we saw same-store sales from Walmart impress The Street with an upside of 3.8 percent.\" Target's higher quality, albeit more expensive offerings, appear to be out of reach for the average Joe or Jane on Main Street. They are turning on the red and white retail giant, finding their dollar stretches further when shopping at Walmart. Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi reiterates: \"Everywhere you look in this Target quarter, it stunk from top to bottom. They noted that inflation is starting to slow, but they are not seeing a corresponding improvement in sales.\"\u00a0 Inflation appears to be the key catalyst for Target's struggling sales. In response to this continued sales drop, the company announced price cuts to around 5,000 of their products, with more price cuts coming over the summer. D.A. Davidson Managing Director Michael Baker sees this as a bullish move, \"the key right now is for them to get customers in the door, and win back some traffic and win back some market share.\" So although Target may be down, they certainly are not out.\u00a0 Consumers may not have turned on Target, they simply just cannot afford it. Former Toys\"R\"US CEO Jerry Storch states: \"Target has made it's name selling nice-to-have fun products. That is not what the consumer is buying right now!\" Despite these current struggles, Target has proven itself as a quality company with \"a great deal of consumer brand equity,\" even with a strike out earnings report in 2024 \"consumers still love shopping there, so I think they have a lot to work with, it's just going to take awhile.\"\u00a0 This post was written by Noah Chadwick      GFX_AE",

What you have in Target right now is really a large convenience grocery store, whereas Walmart is the nation's largest real grocery store with all the departments and fresh produce... That positions Target very poorly. They can't fix that overnight,\" Storch says.

For Target, it's \"backwards\" Storch argues, saying that customers may be going once a month for general items and buying low-margin groceries since they happen to be there.\u00a0 For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.

Forrester Research Retail Analyst Sucharita Kodali joins Wealth! to discuss the state of the consumer as inflationary pressures continue to pose a challenge. \"The consumer has been feeling really down about the economy for a long time, pretty much since inflation has been prevalent ... But the irony is that retail spending is at a record high, and consumers for a long time were spending at the level of inflation and then some,\" Kodali explains. She adds that recent data has shown retail spending cooling, which could indicate that \"the consumer is finally probably at their saturation point with respect to spending on some of these discretionary goods in particular.\" Kodali notes that Walmart (WMT) and warehouse clubs are performing well due to a value-conscious trend among consumers. However, Dollar Tree is falling behind as the dollar channel is \"incredibly saturated.\" She adds that the chain's stores need renovations and maybe even location changes to perform better. The company may not be willing to make these investments, she explains, which is why it is exploring a potential sale.

American Giant founder and CEO Bayard Winthrop joins Market Domination Overtime to discuss the partnership and some of the core principles behind the brand. \"It was a real breakthrough moment for our brand, and for textiles more broadly, when you have a partner like Walmart stepping up to a long-term commitment and a volume commitment that allows the supply chain partners to really rethink the way they're thinking about producing apparel in the United States again,\" Winthrop says. While textiles cost more to produce in the US, he believes the benefits are worth it: \"When you make things here, you do it within the constraints of the American system, which includes human rights protections, environmental protections, child labor protections, living wages, things that I think we all as Americans really appreciate.\" Winthrop stresses the importance of investing in America's manufacturing capabilities and workforce, explaining, \"We begin to give good opportunities to those towns, those cities that want to have good, viable, and dignified work. And so that was a real founding mission for our brand.\" He notes that American Giant fulfills the need of consumers looking for access to good-quality, American-made products at reasonable prices. He adds, \"I think the larger brands and retailers have, as a generalized statement, tried to be a part of the solution here. And I think this now points a way forward for them to join the conversation.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination Overtime.

        "summary": "On today's episode of Wealth!, Host Brad Smith breaks down some of the biggest stories impacting your personal finances, from the global market sell-off to an interest rate cut in September from the Federal Reserve. The major indexes (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) are slipping as recession fears trigger a widespread sell-off among investors. However, Fort Washington Investment Advisors co-chief investment officer Chris Shipley believes the current downturn shouldn't cause investor panic. He notes the market had \"a certain vulnerability\" due to expectations of economic growth and lower inflation. Yet, there turned out to be \"a little more economic weakness than the market was banking on,\" indicating the economy is entering \"a more substantial slowdown.\" He views the current situation as an ideal buying opportunity, pointing to companies like Nvidia (NVDA), which hasn't seen low share prices since March or April, noting: \"When stocks are on sale, it's time to start taking a look.\" Zacks Investment Management client portfolio manager Brian Mulberry argues that the market has been \"a little bit overdue for a pullback like this.\" Amid the sell-off, he encourages investors to focus on companies with high-quality balance sheets, multiple revenue streams, low levels of debt, and good cash flow metrics. He points to consumer staples (XLP) as good investment opportunities. Some investors are concerned about the pullback's effects on their long-term retirement investments. Vanguard senior wealth advisor Cassandra Rupp, CFP, says, \"We can only control what we can control,\" and breaks down some of the biggest mistakes when managing 401(k) plans: \"Everyone's time horizon can be different. I mean, if we're speaking to some of this reporting in 401(k)'s for retirement savings, depends on what stage of your career you're at. We're seeing an increase in participant deferral rates above 4% now. So we're seeing more and more individuals start to automatically save out of their paychecks into these types of plans.\" Yahoo Finance Senior Columnist Kerry Hannon adds that if you're investing in a retirement account, you will experience periods where you're buying high and periods where you're buying low. In the end, it'll most likely even out. In response to recent signs of economic weakness, Wall Street is convinced the Federal Reserve will almost certainly cut rates by 50 basis points at their September meeting. However, with investors believing the Fed may be delayed in rate reductions, speculation is growing about a potential cut even sooner. Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Jennifer Schonberger breaks down the details, discussing how the Fed can implement rate cuts outside of their scheduled meetings and historical trends that prompted emergency rate cuts.

Amid the sell-off, he encourages investors to focus on companies with high-quality balance sheets, multiple revenue streams, low levels of debt, and good cash flow metrics. He points to consumer staples (XLP) as good investment opportunities, highlighting names like Walmart (WMT) and Coca-Cola (KO) since \"being concentrated on quality is how you're going to survive this particular sell down in the market.\" As major tech stocks have dipped amid the global market sell-off, Mulberry believes that the companies actually monetizing AI will be in a better standing among competitors. \"The dividing line is going to be, 'what is your business model?' There's been an enormous amount of investment from all of those companies in this type of technology. But who's actually closing the loop and generating revenue from AI?\" he explains. He points to Microsoft (MSFT) as one of those names as it generates revenue from its subscription service that allows users to access ChatGPT through the Microsoft Office suite.

        "summary": "On today's episode of Wealth!, Host Brad Smith breaks down key stories impacting your personal finances, from the risk of a recession to new housing propositions from the Harris administration. Stocks (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) are recovering as markets look to the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in September amid signs of cooling inflation. Allspring Global Investments senior portfolio manager and head of global liquidity solutions Jeff Weaver highlights July's CPI data, calling it \"good for the Fed,\" as well as markets and consumers. He notes the economy remains \"strong,\" with interest rates coming down incrementally, \"and that's what's driving a lot of flows.\" One risk Weaver points out is a rise in the unemployment rate. August's consumer sentiment data topped economist estimates, as reported by the University of Michigan, showing an increase for the first time in five months. This positive trend aligns with strong retail sales figures for July and robust earnings reports from retail giants like Walmart (WMT), all suggesting continued consumer resiliency. Yahoo Finance anchor Julie Hyman delves into the details, analyzing what all this data reveals about the current state of the consumer. H&R Block (HRB) shares are trading higher following the company's fourth-quarter earnings beat on both top and bottom lines, driven by its artificial intelligence initiatives. H&R Block CEO Jeff Jones emphasizes that while the company is \"known for consumer tax preparation,\" they're diversifying into areas such as small business services and mobile banking. Mortgage rates ticked higher this week, however, they have been trending downward over the last year. William Raveis Mortgage regional vice president Melissa Cohn elaborates on what it will take to get people back to the housing market in droves: \"If we want to see the floodgates open, I would say that the rate has to go down to 5.5%. But the fact that we're down to 6.5% or just below that, or if you think about it, we were not too long ago hovering in the mid-sevens. I think that every quarter percent cut in interest rates will sort of bring that next level or next group of buyers back into the marketplace.\" Vice President Kamala Harris's campaign has outlined some big plans for revitalizing the housing industry, from the construction of 3 million new homes over the next four years to tax incentives for builders who construct starter homes. Author of Your Money Playbook and former NFL player Brandon Copeland notes that one of the biggest fears young people have today is whether they will ever be able to afford the home of their dreams.

Rainey explains the the company is positioned well for any tough times ahead: \"I think what's important to understand about our business and what we're demonstrating with these results is that we're a business that is positioned to do well during tougher times, maybe more recessionary times, but we're also doing very well in more expansionary times, too. And that's because our business has changed. Walmart simply is different today than it was a decade ago. We're providing convenience for customers, and you see that in our e-commerce growth. Brian mentioned the growth in e-commerce. It grew 21% in the quarter.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.

And so that does favor retailers like Walmart,\" Baker tells Yahoo Finance. Baker emphasizes that Walmart's success goes beyond just offering value. He highlights the company's investments in convenience, improved product mix, and store upgrades, stating that \"all those things are helping them not only win market share but keep that market share.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

        "summary": "Walmart (WMT) released its second quarter earnings, inching past top and bottom line estimates. The retail giant also raised its full-year sales and profit guidance after seeing strength in the consumer. As many consumers have felt the pressure of inflation, with some retailers and financial analysts claiming there has been a more discerning consumer, why has Walmart seen this level of success versus some other retailers? Forrester Research retail analyst Sucharita Kodali joins Wealth! to give insight into the strength of the consumer and what it means for the broader market moving forward. \"I don't think that I'm as optimistic about the future of the retail economy and the consumer attitudes as maybe the market seems to suggest. And the reason for that is that what I'm looking at is how is growth relative to inflation, and what we've seen over the last several months, and definitely the most recent retail data from the [US Census Bureau] suggested the same,\" says Kodali, \"which is that consumer spending is essentially in line and in some categories below the rates of inflation. So that means that even though the numbers may be positive, the consumer is really, really softening.\" She follows that up, claiming Walmart's numbers are coming from lower-income consumers taking on more debt: \"They are the most stretched, and they are likely driving some of these strong Walmart numbers, because even though Walmart is growing, a lot of other retailers are not. So Walmart's growth, I would argue, is probably coming at the expense of other retailers that consumers may have been spending money with during the pandemic.\" Catch the full interview with Walmart Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey from Thursday morning.

        "summary": "On today's episode of Morning Brief, Seana Smith and Brad Smith analyze the market open and cover some of the biggest stories of the trading day. Stocks (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) charged ahead at the market open, riding high on July's retail sales data and the most recent jobless claims print. Initial jobless claims for the week ending in August 10 ticked lower to 227,000, coming in below the estimated 235,000. This is the second week of declines for jobless claims, indicating a continued strength in the labor market. Meanwhile, July's retail sales rose 1%, soaring past estimates of a 0.4% increase. This comes as inflation continues to moderate, and signals overall resiliency in consumer spending. As Wall Street breathed a sigh of relief, BMO Wealth Management US chief investment officer Yung-Yu Ma explains that there's a \"very strong confluence of data now, along with Fed comments that they're ready to cut rates and stand ready to respond to labor market softness.\" Therefore, he argues that \"the soft landing is firmly in place,\" and the stage has been set for growth acceleration into early 2025. Walmart's (WMT) second quarter earnings also spoke to the consumer resiliency highlighted in July's retail sales data. The company beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines and raised its full-year sales and profit guidance. Walmart Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey says the consumer has remained consistent and is \"hanging in there\" despite uncertainty surrounding the election and geopolitical events. Shares of Cisco Systems (CSCO) are climbing in the stock's biggest intraday gain since March of 2020. The company topped its fiscal fourth quarter earnings expectations and announced a 7% cut in its workforce as it shifts priorities. Cisco CFO Scott Herren notes that the AI, cybersecurity, cloud, and networking areas of the business are seeing the fastest growth, which Cisco is investing heavily into. As the company evolves, he sees security and networking becoming increasingly intertwined businesses as customers seek secure networks. Brinker International (EAT), the parent company of restaurant chains Chili's and Maggiano's Little Italy, saw comparable sales jump 13.5% year-over-year, as reported in its fiscal fourth quarter earnings. The company attributes this feat to higher restaurant traffic and its increase in menu prices. Brinker International CEO and President Kevin Hochman explains: \"We know things are tough out there, but we have this industry-leading value. And we've spent a lot of time in the last two years and a lot of investments on improving the experience. So that means making sure we have more labor in the restaurants, we've reduced our menu by over 22%, and we put also investments into facilities.\" This post was written by Melanie Riehl",

R5 Capital Founder and CEO Scott Mushkin joins Market Domination to discuss whether this disparity is driven by consumer behavior or company-specific factors. Mushkin describes the current consumer as \"funny,\" noting a pullback in spending dating back to early spring. He highlights that inflation has particularly affected middle to lower-end consumers. However, when examining specific companies, Mushkin points to Walmart as a top pick, emphasizing that \"it's them, not that the consumer's okay\" because their \"core\" customer is still facing challenges in this environment. \"We're really key on retailers that are doing self-help,\" Mushkin tells Yahoo Finance. He identifies three companies becoming increasingly dominant: Walmart, Costco (COST), and Amazon (AMZN). \"Their business models are extraordinarily advantaged and becoming more advantaged,\" Mushkin explains. Their improved business operations allow them to control prices and drive market share. He adds, \"It's really hard not to see them gaining more and more share.\" Catch Yahoo Finance's exclusive interview with Walmart CFO John David Rainey from last week.

Look, take a look at retail sales year-over-year for the last two years, there's maybe been one month out of two years where the pace of growth of retail sales year-over-year has actually exceeded the rate of inflation...in almost all cases, inflation has been higher year-over-year, the CPI growth, than the rate of growth in retail sales, which are not adjusted for inflation,\" say Storch. He follows that up with: \"So consumers feel like, and in fact, it's true, that they're spending more money and getting less.

This move raises questions about the broader implications for China's e-commerce landscape. KraneShares chief investment officer Brendan Ahern joins Market Domination Overtime to analyze this development. Ahern notes that domestic consumption in China has been \"scarred\" by COVID-19 and \"the downdraft in real estate prices,\" which is weighing on China's \"domestic consumption story.\" This adversely impacts major e-commerce players like JD, Alibaba (BABA), and Pinduoduo (PDD), as Ahern describes it as \"a tougher space\" overall. Delving deeper into the Walmart-JD partnership, Ahern explains that it had lasted for over eight years. However, he believes Walmart has now established a strong enough footing in China that \"they no longer need a partner.\" Ahern suggests the partnership was even \"encroaching on JD's core e-commerce business,\" both online and offline. As a result, he does not interpret this move as Walmart trying to withdraw from China's economy. Instead, Ahern views it as Walmart declaring, \"we have enough bandwidth to go alone,\" characterizing the relationship with JD as a \"frenemy relationship.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination Overtime.

Storch Advisors CEO, Former Toys R Us CEO, and Former Hudson's Bay CEO Jerry Storch joins Market Domination to give insight into retail earnings from Macy's and Target and what it means for the sector moving forward. Storch says plainly: \"I think all these reports have been very consistent. I'd like to say it's an open book exam and the results from the earnings we've seen over the last two weeks are very consistent. The consumer remains stressed. They're leveraged. They're running out of pandemic money. And inflation has been hurting their ability to spend on discretionary items.\" In terms of what the data signals about the consumer, Storch points out Walmart's (WMT) recent earnings: \"Walmart just last week posted a 4.2% same-store sales gain, more than doubled Target's and on the internet, Target was up around 9%, Walmart was up 22%. So Walmart is absolutely crushing it with their strong value, low-price message, and Target, who's trying to get that back, they lowered a lot of prices, they're emphasizing that, did better than they've been doing, but still lags a lot. So we're seeing a consumer who is looking for value and every piece of data that comes out supports that.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

The first one being that as you mentioned, retailers are all about the omnichannel strategy. And this is what's important in order to attract the consumers to the stores. Home Depot (HD), Walmart, Lowe's (LOW) yesterday all told us, and even Target today they smashed their e-commerce estimate with a robust 8.3% growth in e-commerce. Consumers are are ordering things on their mobile phones and then wanting to pick them up in store on their way from work to home. And so this is really what's driving sales,\" says Martis Martis points out how consumers are really focused on value, \"they are shopping at the discounters, off-price retailers.\" She adds \"The trend this year has been like you saw July retail sales... really smashing expectations. And that was because the average promotional rate and the amount of merchandise on sale really spiked to the highest level it did all year round. So we're going to continue to see things like this around Labor Day weekend, already people are shopping for Halloween.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Wealth!

        "summary": "Stronger-than-expected retail sales, along with earnings reports from retail giants like Walmart (WMT), have suggested a more robust American consumer. But is this really the case? Are consumers genuinely regaining their strength? D.A. Davidson senior analyst Michael Baker and Retail Cities managing director Bryan Gildenberg joins Morning Brief to share their perspectives on the consumer outlook. Baker believes the consumer is slowing down, forecasting that \"most retailers will guide down for the back half\" of 2024. However, he points out that Walmart is \"one big exception,\" emphasizing that its performance reflects its continued ability to take market share, \"not necessarily the strength of the consumer.\" \"It's definitely a slowing environment, despite those data points from last week,\" Baker states. Gildenberg highlights inflation in the US, particularly in shelter costs, as a factor contributing to stretched consumer wallets. \"I think it will be interesting to see over time as the Fed [Federal Reserve] lowers interest rates... the impact of that has on liquidity in the housing market, the impact that that has on unplugging the logjam at the top of the rental market, and I think that'll help retailers that are selling to renters that are trying to make ends meet,\" he tells Yahoo Finance.

        "summary": "Shares of Dollar General (DG) plunged over 30% on Thursday after the company slashed its full-year guidance, with the CEO warning its core consumer is cash strapped. Piper Sandler managing director Peter Keith joins Market Domination to give insight into what's driving Dollar General's stock price. He notes that Walmart (WMT) is a problem for Dollar General, saying that it's a \"giant vacuum cleaner sucking up a lot of market share,\" citing that part of the reason why is Walmart's digital strategy.\u00a0 Keith elaborates on why Dollar General is performing poorly during the current economic landscape: \"When we're in this a little bit tighter consumer spending environment where normally Dollar General would be picking up market share, seeing what they call trade in or trade down, new customers coming into Dollar General. That's not happening. Those customers are going to Walmart because they like the digital capabilities. And frankly, you know, Dollar General, the dollar store model isn't very digital.\" He follows up with how the company could turn it around: \"We do think they need to build out a more robust, digital playbook that if they want to get younger customers, they want to get more middle-income customers. There are certain basic things around digital shopping and e-commerce that are just demanded these days.\" Watch the video above to hear what Keith said about Best Buy's (BBY) Q2 results.

        "summary": "As September begins, many investors are anticipating the Federal Reserve to begin cutting interest rates at its September meeting. However, questions remain around how consumers and markets (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) are faring in the current rate environment and whether a soft landing is on the horizon. To give deeper insights into the economy, Crossmark Global Investments chief market strategist Victoria Fernandez joins Morning Brief. While the consumer has been portrayed as resilient during this period of economic uncertainty, Fernandez questions whether this is truly the case. Although retailers like Walmart (WMT) are outperforming, suggesting strong consumer spending, Fernandez fears to overlook the fact that Walmart is a budget retailer catering to lower-income consumers. \"Is Walmart doing better because the consumer is out there spending more and excited to spend more, or is Walmart doing better because their base grew, because they had to bring in normally higher-income earners that shop other places are now coming into Walmart?\" she questions. \"I think that's part of the story.\" Regarding the possibility of a soft landing, Fernandez states, \"I think there's a lot of uncertainties that we'd get a soft landing. I'm not saying we'd go full-on recession, but I think we could be waiting for a larger pullback.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.

        "summary": "It's an age-old question among investors: which is better, growth investing or value investing? After the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut this week kicked off a highly-anticipated easing cycle, Catalysts hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills spoke with a panel of experts about how the two investment strategies could play out in the months to come. Vontobel portfolio manager Markus Hansen and Greenwich Wealth's CIO Vahan Janjigian join Catalysts to lay out their investment thesis. Vahan favors value over growth \u2014 but says he's not a strict value investor. \"What I really favor is stocks that are undervalued,\" he says, \"and in many cases, that can be growth stocks.\" In terms of investments, Vahan notes he's leaning toward traditional value stocks, like IBM (IBM), Verizon (VZ), and Pfizer (PFE). And in the wake of the Fed's latest rate cut, Vahan sees small caps (IWM) as benefitting from changes to the yield curve. \"I think as things normalize, we'll get back to what's considered normal. And that means value stocks outperform growth stocks and small cap stocks outperform large cap stocks.\" Markus and his team at Vontobel are quality growth focused. He says post-rate cut, he expects dividends will get a lot of love from investors. That's why he's favoring \"good old fashioned names\" like Coca-Cola (KO), Walmart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), and PepsiCo (PEP) for their sustained dividend growth. Luxury is also a sector he finds compelling for its wide economic moat. \"It requires time to build that heritage, and to be the top brand,\" he says, and that longevity makes companies like Hermes (RMS.PA), Ferrari (RACE), and Richemont (CFR.SW) compelling.

Sundaram, however, still has the sector as an Underweight, arguing that cyclical sectors are \"best poised for long-term growth\" given the Federal Reserve rate cuts on the horizon.\u00a0 With some pockets of consumers slowing their spending, Sundaram thinks there will be winners and losers in the space, telling Yahoo Finance he likes big box retailers such as Walmart (WMT), Costco (COST), Target (TGT), and BJ's (BJ).\u00a0 Watch the video above to hear what it is about those stocks Sundaram likes.

He notes that Walmart has only been able to compete on value over the last decade, saying, \"They had the same 5,000ish stores, and they were as convenient as they ever were going to be.\" However, the COVID pandemic ended up being a catalyst for Walmart as many consumers turned to online shopping. \"That allows Walmart to compete with new customers for the first time that are still out of the range of those 5,000 stores. So they're now able to offer a convenience element that wasn't available to them on top of being one of the most valued positioned retailers,\" he tells Yahoo Finance. Kirk adds, \"So that is a whole new paradigm that is available to Walmart and is leading to them gaining share.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.

This mindset helped Cornell rise the retail ranks. He has served in executive roles at major companies like Safeway and Sam\u2019s Club before running Target. Cornell took over when the retailer was struggling and coming off of a data breach. The CEO\u2019s first big move was to exit Canada, after the company\u2019s $5.4 billion venture north of the border failed to take off. In 2017 Cornell announced the $550 million acquisition of delivery company Shipt and a $7 billion investment in Target stores, at a time when the industry appeared to be shifting away from brick-and-mortar. These decisions paid off during the pandemic, when Target\u2019s revenue shot up past $100 billion for the first time in 2021. Recently, Target has missed the mark compared to competitors, with comparable sales falling for four straight quarters through the first quarter of 2024. Target\u2019s declining numbers were due to a number of factors, including retail theft, a backlash to Pride merchandise in 2023, and excess inventory resulting in price cuts, with the main driver being a slowdown in discretionary spending by consumers. Nearly 50% of Target\u2019s product portfolio is made up of non-essentials\u2014much higher than many competitors. To drive growth into the future, Cornell and Target are mixing strategies old and new. The company plans to invest in 300 stores over the next decade, continuing a trend under Cornell. In April of 2024 Target announced a paid membership program, Target Circle 360, to compete with Amazon Prime and Walmart+. The most recent numbers showed positive signs for the retailer, with sales up 2.7% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2024. Target is set to report third quarter earnings on November 20, where the company expects to see more growth, albeit at a slower rate.

The analyst says the \u201cnumber one\u201d thing he\u2019s looking for out of Costco\u2019s upcoming earnings report is \u201cvery healthy growth in the membership fee income. That is a critical driver of the company's profit and loss statement. It represents about 50% of its total income. So monitoring that metric is important.\u201d He adds he will also be watching for \u201chow its margins are performing. What we look at is a key metric called core. On core gross margin, which is an indicator of how profitability on a particular item is doing this year compared to the same period last year that had been going up in the more recent quarters. It's been going down a little bit as the company invests to try and continue to offer value to its consumers.\u201d Lasser says \u201cCostco is, without question, taking market share. Costco is taking market share from the vast majority of the players in the market, you know, that includes conventional grocery stores, specialty retail stores, mall-based retailers.\u201d He says consumers are attracted to \u201cthe value quality equation\u201d and opportunities to consolidate trips and time spent in stores. \u201cCostco is uniquely well positioned to benefit from both of those trends,\u201d he says.\u201d After Costco\u2019s recent fee hike, Lasser says earnings will offer a look into retention, which he expects to remain strong \u201ceven if it does ease off ever so slightly,\u201d and \u201chow is [the company] using this additional pool of profits that it's going to be able to accrue to increase the value proposition to its consumers.\u201d AutoZone recently reported its fourth quarter earnings results missing expectations, but the stock is still up double-digits year-to-date. Lasser says, \u201cThe reason why the stock is up like it is is because the market is gravitating to sustainable growth stories. If we're sitting here a year from now, there's a lot of uncertainty over the next 12 months. We could walk through those factors. But what the market is saying is that it has a higher degree of confidence that AutoZone will continue to grow its earnings in light of how it's positioned and in light of the market that it serves. More so than other retailers.\u201d For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination. This post was written by Naomi Buchanan.",

Over the majority of Cornell\u2019s tenure, Target has held its own against rivals Amazon (AMZN), Costco (COST), and Walmart (WMT). Cornell led the company to a revenue increase of nearly 50% from 2015 to 2022, peaking at over $109B as part of a pandemic-related spending surge. Since that peak, Target sales and profits have dipped due to a decline in discretionary spending among consumers, and other factors, including retail theft. In 2022 alone, inventory shrinkage, mostly in the form of retail theft, shaved off $700M from the company\u2019s profits. Following a wave of high-profile \u2018smash and grabs,\u2019 including several at Target stores, Target and other retailers have leaned in to increased security and technology to not only reduce and deter theft but to make stores safer and more accessible for customers. These efforts, along with government involvement, are already having an impact, according to Cornell. \u201cI feel so much better today than I did a year ago, and I think it comes back to support at the federal level, at the state level and at the local level,\u201d Cornell says. \u201cTo be clear, we do not like locking up product, but we like running stores and we want to keep our stores open.

Many groups providing aid will only accept cash donations because the needs are not fully known and it does not require additional resources to get the donations to those in need.  Because damage from Helene is spread out over six states in an area that reaches from Florida's Big Bend to the Appalachians in Virginia, experts say to look for groups with a history of aid in the specific city or state you want to help so that your donation reaches your intended area more quickly.",

Initially raised to a Category 5 in days prior, Milton has been downgraded back to a Category 4 as it nears Florida. Tampa Electric CEO and President Archie Collins told Yahoo Finance its grid restoration effort will be the \"the biggest in in our history\" in the wake of Milton. In 2022, Hurricane Ian did \"$121 billion [in damages] and it only hit Fort Myers and swampland. [Milton] is hitting Tampa, Sarasota, Disney, Cape Canaveral, I mean this is hitting a lot of assets. So we're projecting at least $121 billion [in damages],\" Weather Trends International Founder and CEO Bill Kirk tells Madison Mills and Seana Smith on Catalysts. Weather Trends International is a private company that provides weather coverage and guidance to clients such as major retailers, manufacturers, and agricultural producers. Kirk comments on what Hurricane Milton and its subsequent damages could mean for home improvement retailers such as Lowe's (LOW), Home Depot (HD), and Tractor Supply Company (TSCO), and Weather Trends International's findings on this year's weather and climate patterns. \"Q4 we think is very strong. We have a very cooler, wetter, snowier La Ni\u00f1a-type winter, so we think it'll be stronger. Last year was the hottest in history right, so the sales were delayed until the polar vortex hit in January last year. This year you're moving all those sales up at full price full margin product,\" Kirk says on weather predictions. \"So we're very bullish on Q4 and then we have a train wreck in 2025. I mean, we have cold wet spring, we have snow in April...\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts\u00a0here.

        "summary": "On today's episode of Wealth!, Host Brad Smith breaks down some of the top tips for everything from positioning your portfolio to planning your holiday shopping. As the third quarter earnings season kicks off, Keith Buchanan, GLOBALT Investments senior portfolio manager, breaks down what investors can expect. \"The expectations for earnings have started to accelerate from mid-single digits to next year to mid-double digits. And coming into this fourth quarter is a real transition quarter from that lower healthy growth to robust growth,\" he tells Yahoo Finance. Thus, he expects areas like financials (XLF), industrials (XLI), and consumer discretionary (XLY) to be poised for growth heading into 2025, explaining, \"Those valuations are miles away from where they traditionally trade on a relative to the broader S&P 500 (^GSPC).\" The AI race is just getting started, and Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood is betting big. Asking for a Trend Host Josh Lipton dives into Cathie Wood's OpenAI investment and why she's so bullish on the company. Black, Hispanic, and Latina women are newer to investing and focused on building generational wealth, a recent J.P. Morgan Wealth Management report found. JPMorgan Wealth Management head of communications Ver\u00f3nica Navarro Espinosa explains that education, accessibility, and confidence are helping break down barriers. \u201cInvesting is overwhelming. There is so much information everywhere that is hard to decide where you're going to go. But we're starting to see that there is a path forward. We're seeing people are starting to be more comfortable. Also, the tools to invest are becoming more accessible,\" she says. Despite cooling inflation, many American household budgets remain under pressure \u2014 particularly those of retirees. However, some relief may be on the way as Social Security's cost of living adjustment (COLA) is expected to increase benefits by 2.5%. Yahoo Finance Senior Columnist Kerry Hannon breaks down the details, examining how this benefit adjustment is calculated, its impact on Social Security beneficiaries, and the broader challenges Americans face when saving for retirement. A Missouri federal judge placed an injunction on President Biden's SAVE student loan forgiveness plan, which features a clause to eliminate 100% of remaining interest for loan borrowers. As the plan sits in legal purgatory, Edvisors director of corporate communications Elaine Rubin breaks down the Biden administration's biggest hurdles in pushing forward its student loan forgiveness agenda. \"So in this election year, we know that the Kamala [Harris] administration, they are aiming to continue some of the plans that the Biden administration has already started. So defending the SAVE Plan and going towards that broad forgiveness,\" Rubin explains. The fall travel season is officially here, and over half of travelers plan to manage the cost of their trips by cutting back on other expenses, according to Hopper. Hopper lead economist Hayley Berg notes that travelers should book their travel by October 14, when they can get the best airfare prices on their holiday travel. She adds that prices for holiday travel increase after Halloween. She also encourages travelers to be flexible with their travel dates, explaining that you can save about $200 per domestic ticket just by being flexible around your Thanksgiving and Christmas travel dates. While these holidays are the cheapest travel days, she explains that Monday or Wednesday before Thanksgiving, and Monday before Christmas Eve are the other cheapest times to fly. Consumers are shopping early for the holiday season, turning to retailers offering discounts, a recent CNET survey shows. Dashia Milden, CNET money editor, explains, \"The majority of shoppers right now are planning on leaning on those early holiday sales. When we start thinking about [Amazon\u2019s (AMZN)] Prime Day sales literally launching tomorrow. Target (TGT), Walmart (WMT), Best Buy (BBY), you name it.\" On top of looking for deals, shoppers are also cutting down their holiday spending. She tells Yahoo Finance, \u201cThe majority of shoppers are shopping early to try to take advantage of some of those savings, and they're still making sacrifices. A percentage are spending less on non-essentials, such as travel and dining. People are setting smaller budgets, even and even choosing to go ahead and get fewer gifts. So when we start looking at that, it's very clear that the holidays are important and that they're willing to make some sacrifices in the meantime.\u201d For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Wealth!

        "summary": "Procter & Gamble (PG) reported mixed first quarter earnings Friday morning. The company's adjusted earnings per share of $1.93 surpassed the expected $1.90. However, revenue fell short of estimates, coming in at $21.74 billion, just below the anticipated $21.96 billion. Following the report, CEO and President Jon Moeller joined Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi to discuss the company's performance. Moeller addressed a key question for the North American market: \"Can we grow meaningful unit volume at the new prices that we've moved to as a result of the commodity cost increases?\" He noted that they achieved this, with volume up 4% in the North American business this quarter. Over the last five quarters, he highlighted an average of 3-4 points of growth in the region, demonstrating \"a very strong consumer that's being offered a very good value.\" Despite increased commodity costs in the region, the company has managed to sustain volume growth. Regarding the US consumer and the inflationary environment, Moeller explains, \"We try to ensure that we have offerings that are available across the price ladder for consumers who have different outlay needs.\" He mentions this approach includes tailored pack offerings for budget-conscious consumers, emphasizing the company's commitment to value-driven performance. \"Our whole model depends on delighting a number of constituents: delighting consumers, delighting customers, delighting employees, delighting society, delighting shareholders. And I firmly believe that if we fail to do one of those, we will fail to do all of them,\" Moeller explains to Yahoo Finance. He goes on to add that, when it comes to small packaging sizes, \"Smaller sizes, in general, ... are more costly to produce. So it's not intuitive that you grow margin by doing that. But there are times where we will reduce the size of an offering ... because that, at times, increases affordability. So it's based on a desire to increase value, approachability, affordability of our products.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief\u00a0here.

You have to remember coming out of the last several years, we had everything from supply chain challenges to other issues related to the fact that retailers just were not promoting as much. So we're seeing starting last year, and certainly this year, much, much heavier promotional activity, especially given that consumers may be cautious to open their wallets,\" Kodali tells Yahoo FInnace. Thus, she expects retailers to increase the number and duration of promotions this holiday season. She points to major names like Amazon (AMZN) and Walmart (WMT) that are in a position to benefit. Kodali also points to Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Crocs (CROX), and Abercrombie (ANF) as brands that are also performing well and could get a boost during the holiday season.

        "summary": "On today's episode of Wealth!, Host Brad Smith breaks down some of the latest data, from initial jobless claims to the outlook for small businesses. US stocks (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) continue to climb as the bull market maintains its momentum. Aptus Capital Advisors portfolio manager David Wagner jobserves that the market is reaching new highs \"from different whys.\" While the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech giants have driven most market gains over the past 18 months, he notes this trend is now broadening to other sectors and stocks. Wagner points to \"undervalued\" areas, such as US small caps and international stocks, which began outperforming in the third quarter. However, some volatility may lie ahead as the market enters its third year of a bull run. Initial jobless claims for the week ending on October 12 came in below estimates, falling to 241,000 against expectations of 259,000. Yahoo Finance anchor Madison Mills joins Brad Smith to break down the fresh labor print, taking into account the data distortion from recent hurricanes in southern states. According to the latest data from the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB), confidence among home builders rose to a four-month high in October. Jim Tobin, NAHB CEO, explains that home builder confidence is up because of falling interest rates. He tells Yahoo Finance that the Federal Reserve's rate-cutting cycle \"is really giving our members, and our survey members in particular, a feeling that we're on the backside of the bad news and that we are looking forward to a lower interest rate environment, certainly for mortgage rates in the future, and that the market is going to come back strong.\" Mortgage rates rose for the third consecutive week, according to the latest data out from Freddie Mac, pushing the 30-year fixed rate mortgage to 6.44%. Yahoo Finance senior housing reporter Claire Boston breaks the latest mortgage rates and explains the implications this has for potential homebuyers struggling to find affordable options in the US housing market. Meanwhile, retail sales topped economist expectations for September, according to the US Census Bureau, rising 0.4% month-over-month. Sucharita Kodali, Forrester Research retail analyst, explains that non-store retailers like Amazon (AMZN) are seeing the most gains. She notes that apparel has \"recovered from its pandemic depths,\" while home-related retailers are struggling as interest rates remain relatively high. StockX CEO Scott Cutler discusses trends in the resale space and what they say about consumer behavior heading into the holiday shopping season. \u201cThe state of the resale market right now is super dynamic. This year, we've probably seen the biggest shifts in market share that we've ever seen, at least in StockX's history. And you see this also reflected in the public markets. On the one side, you've got the challenges associated with Nike, which has really been driven by restocks, oversupply [and] a lack of innovation. But if you look at the price performance in the resale markets as well as market share gains, where is it happening? Adidas (ADDYY), Asics (ASCCY), Deckers (DECK), which is Hoka and Uggs, and Crocs (CROX),\" he tells Yahoo Finance. Americans continue to grapple with food price inflation, as evidenced by recent Bureau of Labor Statistics data. The food-at-home index rose 0.4% in September, with the meats, poultry, fish, and eggs categories experiencing a notable 0.8% price increase. Egg prices, in particular, have seen a dramatic 39.6% surge year over year. As Thanksgiving approaches, major food retailers are responding to consumers' financial concerns by introducing new holiday meal deals. Brad Smith delves into the details of these offerings, highlighting some of the top promotions from major retailers like Walmart (WMT) and Aldi. These companies are striving to deliver what they're calling an \"inflation-free holiday meal,\" helping customers enjoy their Thanksgiving celebrations without breaking the bank. Approximately 66% of small business owners report that their enterprises are thriving despite facing economic headwinds. Head of Business Banking for the Northeast Region at JPMorgan Chase Robert Rodriguez characterizes small business owners as \"a resilient bunch,\" acknowledging their ability to adapt and persevere. While inflationary pressures remain a concern, he identifies several key challenges facing small businesses today: labor shortages, supply chain disruptions, and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite these obstacles, Rodriguez notes that owners maintain an optimistic outlook for their prospects heading into 2025. This post was written by Melanie Riehl",

You\u2019d rather go with those companies that beat and raise guidance, even if you have to pay up for it.\u201d Mahoney says he's looking for companies he wants to buy again. \u201cThey're going to appear to be kind of expensive. They may take out the year high, but behind it is momentum. Behind it is still those analysts [who] are still playing catch up. So, to us, it separates the men from the boys, so to speak. We'll see that this earnings season as we'll see every other earnings season.\u201d As far as specific names, Mahoney says, \u201cWe like technology because they're more consistent.\u201d With consideration to his earnings framework and the ongoing AI trade, he says \u201cWe love Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple.

That was higher than the 0.3% economists were expecting, according to Bloomberg. September's headline number was also revised upwards.\u00a0 LSEG Director of Consumer Research Jharonne Martis says the data point that stood out to her was the year-over-year growth in e-commerce sales. She notes that the October data benefits from Amazon's (AMZN) Prime Deal Days but adds that other retailers piggyback off that promotion and offer their own deals. \"It's telling us the consumer is still gravitating toward those online deals,\" she says. When it comes to the e-commerce business, Martis thinks Walmart (WMT) is starting to give Amazon some more competition. Why? \"They're giving the consumer the ability to shop the way they want to, whether it be ordering it on your mobile... and picking it up at the store on your way home or just having it delivered right there from the store to your house. Walmart is definitely giving Amazon a lot of competition,\" she tells Yahoo Finance. Watch the video above to hear which companies Martis is watching this holiday season and how tariffs may impact retailers and shoppers.

R5 Capital founder and CEO Scott Mushkin joins Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to discuss why Target's results told a different story than Walmart's (WMT) earnings beat. \"Walmart's done an excellent job. There's no doubt about it. Walmart+ membership, getting it to your house very quickly. The other big advantage Walmart has is their produce [and] their fresh food business. And they've actually improved that business [and] the execution there a lot. And, of course, Target has that. But it's not a destination for [fresh food]. So you know Walmart's got some individual things.\" \"We've been negative [about] Walmart before; it's been our No. 1 pick for the last two or three years. But to see the transformation Walmart's done, and it's certainly on merchandising,\" he adds. \"This is a Target problem. I know they blamed the economy and the sluggish consumer, and certainly, certain categories that they are fairly big in are having issues, like home apparel, to a degree. But if we look at our research and take a step back ... We've definitely seen execution at Target become much more inconsistent,\" Mushkin says. Target is good at marketing, branding, social media, and fashion, but its shortcomings in execution create \"a pretty big disconnect\" between \"what's going on in the physical stores and what's going on with the rest of the company, and we think that's a sizable issue for Target.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination here.

        "summary": "Target (TGT) stock tumbles 20% after the company reported earnings results that fell short of analyst estimates. D.A. Davidson managing director and senior research analyst Michael Baker joins Seana Smith and Brad Smith on Morning Brief to discuss the results and what they signal about the retail space ahead of the holiday season. The results \"weren't great,\" Bakers says, explaining there was \"weakness in the third quarter, particularly in discretionary categories. Inventory was a little bit high and continued weakness. [And] it sounds like into the fourth quarter with some potential markdown risks.\" \"Really, the trifecta, I suppose, of bad news, and it is worrisome. I think it's more worrisome for Target specifically than for the overall consumer economy. There are other retailers that are actually doing a little bit better than expected in this environment. So, it does feel like the environment is weighing on Target, but in addition to that, there does seem [to be] some company-specific issues here as well. Watch the video above for more on Baker's expectations for similar retailers like Walmart (WMT).

TD Cowen Senior Research Analyst Oliver Chen provides insights into the retailer's strategic positioning and potential tariff implications. Chen highlights Walmart's competitive advantage, noting the company's massive scale and commitment to everyday low prices, which places it in \"a great negotiating place.\" While the business appears robust, potential tariff increases could significantly impact consumer dynamics. \"The main variable is what percentage of these increases can be passed on to consumers,\" Chen explains. He warns that tariff-driven price increases could pressure lower and middle-income consumers already experiencing economic strain. \"Many companies will be impacted, and those with scale will benefit more,\" Chen emphasizes. He explains management teams have been considering potential tariffs and preparing strategic responses. However, the key variables remain how retailers adjust pricing and consumer reactions to these potential changes.

Julie Hyman and Brian Sozzi welcome JLL (JLL) Americas President of Retail Naveen Jaggi on Catalysts to talk about in-person shopping trends forecasted for this holiday season. \"With all the promotions we're seeing online, on our phone and on our tablets, people now have an incentive to go to the store more than ever. And we're still a consumer that likes to go shopping in person,\" Jaggi explains, stating that the more value-conscious consumer will be able to find these better deals at big-box stores like Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT). He goes on to comment on the experiential trends seen on social media steering shoppers into brick-and-mortar locations. \"We talk a lot about dwell time... So we want now the consumer to not just shop, but we want them to stay a while,\" Jaggi tells Yahoo Finance. \"So it has to be very, very appealing for the Instagram moment or the TikTok moment, and not as much about the bargain, because as we've seen over the last two years, consumers more than ever today, they want that experiential opportunity as opposed to just finding the best price.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts\u00a0here.

        "summary": "Walmart (WMT) is scaling back its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs following pressure from conservative activists. The retailer announced it would discontinue using the term DEI in company communications, cease racial equity staff training, and stop allowing third-party sellers to offer LGBTQ-related items on its website. Bloomberg News reporter Simone Foxman provides insights into this broader corporate trend, noting that while several companies have reduced DEI initiatives, these actions have not significantly impacted stock prices. However, she highlights that investors have been sensitive to companies' handling of partnerships with LGBTQ influencers and related merchandise. \"I think the real question as we move forward is do these announcements and the curtailing of these policies change the way these companies are able to retain talent,\" Foxman tells Yahoo Finance. She emphasizes the potential long-term implications, particularly considering Generation Z's reputation as a \"more open\" and diverse community. \"How much do these changes create happy environments that employees simply want to stay?\" Foxman questions.

Catalysts Co-Hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills sit down with former Attorney General at the Antitrust Division of the US Department of Justice (DOJ) Bill Baer to examine the latest news about the failed merger just ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's second term in office. \"The parties have a right to appeal, but you have two courts who ruled yesterday, one in Washington \u2014 a state court \u2014 and then a federal judge in Oregon, and they basically, in very detailed opinions, said the same things,\" Baer, who is also the former director of the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) Bureau of Competition, says. \"Kroger and Albertsons are each other's closest competitors in many markets all across the country, and because they're closest competitors, if Kroger is allowed to absorb Albertsons in its various brands, it will have extra pricing muscle [and] it will be able to raise prices,\" he says, adding that \"they compete directly with one another,\" rather than Costco (COST) or Walmart (WMT) the judge found. The former DOJ leader says, \"I think this deal goes away, and frankly, it should.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts here.

Dowlatshahi traces the evolution of DEI initiatives following the death of George Floyd in 2020, highlighting how companies initially took \"a strong stance supporting under-represented communities.\" However, he points out the political and social climate has shifted since then, with \"the fall and the rise again of the Trump administration, conservative movement, and far-right movement in the United States, and the 'anti-woke' movements again. And because of that, you see now companies catering to those populations,\" pointing to businesses like Walmart and Lowe's (LOW). Despite these shifts, Dowlatshahi asserts that \"discrimination is still discrimination.\" The attorney remains hopeful that established state and federal laws will continue to protect against workplace discrimination. Although, he acknowledges a concerning trend, telling Yahoo Finance \"I have seen an increase in fear, frankly.\" \"The hope is that we can stand on state and federal law that has been in place for decades and decades,\" the MSD partner concludes.

Walmart CFO John David Rainey says it was all part of the plan. \"It's not an accident that almost 20% of our business is e-commerce now. It's not an accident that we're gaining share, and that's mostly coming from households that make more than a hundred thousand dollars a year. It's not an accident that we delivered over 4 billion items in the last year same day or next day. This is a part of our strategy.\" One place Walmart (WMT) has invested heavily is in its online business. Rainey tells Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi that some parts of the online business are making money, such as Sam's Club and its international business, but the US business isn't quite there yet. He's not worried, though, saying, \"It's no longer a question of if, it's a matter of when,\" adding \"There may be a period of time where we make money and then we invest a little bit more and then it begins to lose money. But all the pieces are in place to do that.\" Rainey is concerned about tariffs, noting that while the company will do what it can to keep prices low, \"tariffs are going to be inflationary for customers.\" Watch the video above to hear what Rainey says is \"one of the underappreciated parts\" of Walmart's business.

In an exclusive interview with Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon explains how pre-pandemic investments are starting to pay off. \"We invested in wages for our associates. We invested in our people, things like education. We invested in lower prices, we invested in e-commerce, we invested in technology, all within a pretty tight period of time,\" he said. One thing that's helping to boost the bottom line is the type of customer Walmart (WMT) is drawing in. The company says it is increasingly attracting more higher-income consumers. McMillon thinks that convenience has been drawing a different customer base. He also discusses inflation, noting that the prices for general merchandise are falling faster than food items. A top-of-mind topic for many CEOs right now is the threat of a trade war, with President-elect Trump threatening to enact more tariffs. McMillon thinks Walmart is \"positioned to manage\" tariffs but worries that customers may see higher prices, even though the retail giant plans to \"do everything we can to try and keep them low.\" There's one technology McMillon is excited about \u2014 generative AI. \"It's going to help us be more anticipatory for customers and members ... The world will look more like personal shopping assistance than it will an old-fashioned search bar with a laundry list of results that you and I then have to work through as a customer. Just saving us time, making it more convenient, helping us solve problems,\" McMillon said of the tech. Watch the video above to hear what McMillon expects for Walmart over the next 10 years.

Jaggi emphasizes the remarkable resilience of US consumer spending. \"I think it really says a lot about the fact that, at the end of the day, this consumer economy keeps finding ways to engage with the consumer,\" he observes. However, Jaggi points out a shift in shopping patterns: \"We have become a value-oriented consumer society.\" Retailers like Ross (ROST), Walmart (WMT), and Target (TGT) are experiencing consistent foot traffic as shoppers seek bargains. This value-hunting extends online, with Jaggi noting that \"the US consumer continues to find ways to find the best bang for the dollar.\" Looking ahead to 2025, Jaggi expresses optimism about the department store sector. He views Nordstrom's (JWN) announcement to go private as \"great news,\" describing the retailer as \"the gold standard\" and suggesting the move will enable better focus on long-term growth strategies. \"Retail requires a long-term mindset,\" he tells Yahoo Finance. \"It does not require a quarter-to-quarter mindset only.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts\u00a0here.
