        "summary": "It has been nearly three weeks since UnitedHealthcare (UNH) CEO Brian Thompson was shot and killed in New York City. The suspected gunman, Luigi Mangione, has been charged with several counts of murder and even terrorism, which he pleaded not guilty to on Monday. In the aftermath of this event, Americans have expressed an outcry over their frustrations with dealing with health insurance providers and maneuvering the cracks in the US healthcare system. Center for Health and Democracy (CHD) President Wendell Potter joins Market Domination's Josh Lipton and Yahoo Finance senior health reporter Anjalee Khemlani to speak more about his self-described \"crisis of conscience\" when he worked within the health industry. Potter penned a New York Times op-ed piece last week titled\u00a0I Was a Health Insurance Executive. What I Saw Made Me Quit. \"I became aware of the barriers that health insurance companies have put in place to assure their profitability, but that have resulted in more and more Americans not being able to get the care that they need, medically necessary care, even with insurance,\" the former Cigna (CI) vice president of communications explains. \"Those barriers that that they put in place to assure profitability and shareholder return really made me walk away. I used to handle financial communications for Cigna, my name was on all of the company's quarterly reports for ten years. So I saw how the company made money, where it came from, what they did with it, but also the way that they were able to earn the profits...\" Potter weighs in on the performance of major health insurance stocks in 2024 and how US policymakers are expected to act to better regulate the industry.

        "summary": "Health insurance claim denials continue to be a significant challenge in the US healthcare system. When insurers reject claims, doctors and hospitals face delays in reimbursement for their services, often leading them to postpone patient care until procedures or treatments receive proper authorization. Recent Medicare data reveals that the industry average for denied claims has reached 17%, with UnitedHealthcare (UNH) showing the highest denial rate at 33%. Yahoo Finance Senior Health Reporter Anjalee Khemlani examines this issue, highlighting automation and artificial intelligence as one of the driving forces behind high denial rates. She discusses implications for healthcare providers and patients, and shares three tips to fight claim denials: 1) never pay the first bill, 2) fight with insurer for coverage, and 3) ask for cash pay options.\u00a0 To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Wealth\u00a0here.

While the stock is currently under scrutiny as the only Magnificent Seven stock declining since November 1, Woods maintains that Nvidia remains fundamentally strong. He says overall, the stock is still in an uptrend. However, he sees a \"near-term head and shoulders top\" formation, which he views as a potential buying opportunity for investors. \"The fundamental story hasn't changed, nothing has changed there,\" Woods tells Madison Mills. \"To me, this is just a pause.\" Addressing the Dow Jones Industrial Average's movement, Woods notes the index is down 3.78% in its nine day losing streak, with UnitedHealth (UNH) leading the decline by erasing 725 points. \"The move is just a garden variety sell-off, but the amount of stocks that are down is a little head-scratching,\" he states. Woods points out one positive: technology, communications, and discretionary sectors continue to lead gains \u2014 the same sectors that initially propelled the current bull market.
