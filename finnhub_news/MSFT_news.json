MDB Capital president and chief market strategist Lou Basenese sits down in-studio with Seana Smith and Madison Mills for a conversation about where he expects market momentum to broaden out in the coming new year. \"The heavy concentration is the fact that if we look at the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500 (^GSPC), expectations are for their growth in earnings to accelerate significantly. So from about 4% this year to 13%,\" Basenese explains. \"So we need other names to pick up and carry the ball in 2025. And I think we're going to see that happen. The tech sector is obviously going to have the strongest growth, but we need to see everyone else participating.\" Basenese goes on to comment about where bitcoin (BTC-USD), the volatility index (^VIX), and even the Federal Reserve fit into market expectations.

He adds that Trump's second term will likely lead to a shift in the US government's attitude toward AI. The Biden administration's \"main approach to artificial intelligence was to say, 'This is an area where we ought to tread carefully, put up guardrails, and focus on safety,'\" Kovacevic says. \"What I think you are going to see with Trump is a pivot from safety to really [seeing] AI as an economic asset for the United States, a national asset for the United States, where we should go out and beat other countries, particularly China in AI.\" Watch the video above to hear more about the expected tech landscape in 2025, including the possible TikTok ban, Big Tech execs courting Trump, Musk's role in the US government, and more.

Freedom Capital Markets chief global strategist Jay Woods speaks with Yahoo Finance about his position on several of the BATMMAAN components. \"The one stock in this group that no one's really talking about too much is Apple. Apple is at $3.8 trillion [market cap]. It's the third biggest in the XLK (XLK) now because they've repositioned that in July,\" Woods tells Catalysts host Madison Mills. \"And to me that is a utility stock that just continues to climb. It's AI story is really just coming to our phones as every upgrade comes to our phone.\" \"The potential on that upgrade cycle and the utility factor that it's been, leads me to believe this could be a $5 trillion company by the end of 2025.\" Also catch Freedom Capital Markets chief global strategist Jay Woods why the sudden downturn in Nvidia shares and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) may not be such a cause for alarm as investors think: \"To me, this is just a pause.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts\u00a0here.
