        "summary": "The Magnificent Seven tech stocks are pulling back as US market indexes (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) decline, contrary to Wall Street's hopes for a Santa Claus rally. What is the next phase of the AI trade and Mag Seven momentum looking like going into 2025? MDB Capital president and chief market strategist Lou Basenese sits down in-studio with Seana Smith and Madison Mills for a conversation about where he expects market momentum to broaden out in the coming new year. \"The heavy concentration is the fact that if we look at the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500 (^GSPC), expectations are for their growth in earnings to accelerate significantly. So from about 4% this year to 13%,\" Basenese explains. \"So we need other names to pick up and carry the ball in 2025. And I think we're going to see that happen. The tech sector is obviously going to have the strongest growth, but we need to see everyone else participating.\" Basenese goes on to comment about where bitcoin (BTC-USD), the volatility index (^VIX), and even the Federal Reserve fit into market expectations. Bernstein Private Wealth Management Senior Investment Strategist Roosevelt Bowman told Yahoo Finance earlier today that the next AI investment plays could include power and energy suppliers and semiconductor cooling technology.

        "summary": "It's the final shopping day before Christmas, and new JLL data shows consumers are expected to spend approximately $1,449 on holiday gifts this year. JLL Americas President of Retail Naveen Jaggi joins Catalysts to analyze what this statistic reveals about consumer behavior and the broader retail sector. Jaggi emphasizes the remarkable resilience of US consumer spending. \"I think it really says a lot about the fact that, at the end of the day, this consumer economy keeps finding ways to engage with the consumer,\" he observes. However, Jaggi points out a shift in shopping patterns: \"We have become a value-oriented consumer society.\" Retailers like Ross (ROST), Walmart (WMT), and Target (TGT) are experiencing consistent foot traffic as shoppers seek bargains. This value-hunting extends online, with Jaggi noting that \"the US consumer continues to find ways to find the best bang for the dollar.\" Looking ahead to 2025, Jaggi expresses optimism about the department store sector. He views Nordstrom's (JWN) announcement to go private as \"great news,\" describing the retailer as \"the gold standard\" and suggesting the move will enable better focus on long-term growth strategies. \"Retail requires a long-term mindset,\" he tells Yahoo Finance. \"It does not require a quarter-to-quarter mindset only.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts\u00a0here.

Rosenberg says he doesn't expect the tech issues that happened with Netflix's Jake Paul and Mike Tyson fight. \"Streaming is a complex process ... [and] sometimes when demand is huge, it overpowers the system, it overwhelms it. You've got delays, and problems arise. But I would not bet against Netflix. I think that the timing of the Jake Paul-Mike Tyson fight was a great test case for Christmas Day.\" \"The best way to get good at streaming at scale is to just do it. There were some hiccups in the fight last month, but I think that they're going to nail it on Christmas Day with these games,\" he adds. \"Up until now, there's been fewer horses in the race [to air sports content], now, with the streamers getting into it,\" Rosenberg says, adding, \"I think that as they develop this expertise where they can deliver these games in a premium experience that people have come to expect from their football, I think that we're going to see more and more competition for these rights as they become available.
