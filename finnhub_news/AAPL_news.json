MDB Capital president and chief market strategist Lou Basenese sits down in-studio with Seana Smith and Madison Mills for a conversation about where he expects market momentum to broaden out in the coming new year. \"The heavy concentration is the fact that if we look at the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500 (^GSPC), expectations are for their growth in earnings to accelerate significantly. So from about 4% this year to 13%,\" Basenese explains. \"So we need other names to pick up and carry the ball in 2025. And I think we're going to see that happen. The tech sector is obviously going to have the strongest growth, but we need to see everyone else participating.\" Basenese goes on to comment about where bitcoin (BTC-USD), the volatility index (^VIX), and even the Federal Reserve fit into market expectations.

He adds that Trump's second term will likely lead to a shift in the US government's attitude toward AI. The Biden administration's \"main approach to artificial intelligence was to say, 'This is an area where we ought to tread carefully, put up guardrails, and focus on safety,'\" Kovacevic says. \"What I think you are going to see with Trump is a pivot from safety to really [seeing] AI as an economic asset for the United States, a national asset for the United States, where we should go out and beat other countries, particularly China in AI.\" Watch the video above to hear more about the expected tech landscape in 2025, including the possible TikTok ban, Big Tech execs courting Trump, Musk's role in the US government, and more.

While the narrow leadership has raised some concerns about concentration and broadening trading themes, Baird Investment strategist Ross Mayfield tells Brad Smith and Madison Mills on Morning Brief that these worries may be overblown. \"It's certainly something we keep an eye on, but I would say that if you had been worried about that concentration or used it as a reason to get out of the market at any point over the last couple of years, it would have been a mistake,\" Mayfield says. The strategist believes investors \"should be celebrating that some of the biggest and most innovative companies are in our markets. Concentration risk, or heavy concentration, has not been a good forward indicator over the last 40 or 50 years based on the data that we've seen.\" \"It's something to keep an eye on [as] it maybe makes the market a little bit more fragile to something like Nvidia having a bad stretch run, but it's not something that we worry about too much,\" Mayfield adds.
