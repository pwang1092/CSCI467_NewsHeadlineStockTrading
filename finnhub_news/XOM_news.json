Mahoney offers suggestions as to how investors can hedge against exogenous foreign relations threats: \"One can use, a military defense company like RTX, Raytheon (RTX), is one of the symbols viewers can take a look at. Oil (BZ=F, CL=F), whether you buy a basket or individual stocks, like Exxon (XOM) or Chevron (CVX). There's definitely ways to go around as a hedge, not as, again, we really think technology and the big tech is still the way to go, the outsized earnings that they have, but if you want to say, hey, I want to hedge my portfolio a little bit, inverse ETFs maybe some oil, maybe some defense contractors or maybe selling off 20-25% put in cash, so we get that wish down.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Wealth!

However, both companies beat Wall Street revenue expectations for the quarter. While some of the forecasts for these companies are mixed, upcoming projects have the potential to turn things around. Truist Managing Director of Energy Research Neal Dingmann joins The Morning Brief to give insight into the energy sector and what investors can expect from Exxon and Chevron moving forward. Dingmann explains that growth will be accelerated by two upcoming projects in particular: \"They're going to have big growth...in Guyana and the Permian [Basin]. That's going to keep the remainder of their overall portfolio flat. Guyana is the one worth pointing out. If you look at the projects coming on through 2027 on a gross basis, which Exxon has 45% of this, that could do almost 1.2 billion barrels a day. You think that: the US alone is doing about 13 billion barrels. This is encroaching on over 10% of what the US alone could do with this project by 2027. That's why it's obviously a big deal on this litigation between Chevron and Exxon on the Hess deal. I cannot say enough about this Ghana project...It's a mega project to say the least. \" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.

Alpine Saxon Woods Chief Market Strategist Sarah Hunt and CFRA Energy Equity Analyst and Deputy Research Director Stewart Glickman join Market Domination to share insight on navigating this sector. Glickman emphasizes that investors looking to capitalize on the energy sector should first consider their outlook for crude oil prices. He believes that with crude oil prices are expected to average between $80 and $90 per barrel in 2024: \"In that kind of environment, you want to be positioned in upstream,\" the analyst tells Yahoo Finance. He recommends exploring names like Exxon (XOM), citing \"a lot of growth potential.\" With an uptick in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity throughout the sector, Glickman notes that the \"common theme\" is exposure to the Permian Basin, a trend he believes is \"likely to persist.\" Hunt acknowledges that supply and demand issues have been a headwind for the sector since the pandemic. However, with an \"energy transition underway\" she remains bullish on energy \"from a longer-term perspective.\" She also highlights the significant consolidation within the sector, with companies combining forces to boost operations and enhance their competitive edge.

        "summary": "As the world moves towards renewable energy, simultaneously making massive investments in AI infrastructure which demands a gargantuan amount of power to run, certain investment opportunities should be on the radar for investors for the long term. TCW Senior Portfolio Manager Eli Horton joins Wealth!  to give insight into why power and energy ETFs may be a smart play for investor portfolios. \u00a0\"We are really starting to see the beginning of what we consider a mega theme or a transformative investment opportunity in the transformation of our energy system. If you think about it, we are in the very early innings of migrating from using all fossil fuels to 100% renewable power generation, and we are only about 15% of the way there,\" Horton cements how much of an opportunity these ETFs may be for investors. \"There's been a lot of lofty targets that we'll make it by 2050 to a net zero state: We won't. This is a very complex challenge. The world's investing $5 to 6 trillion per year to solve this problem.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Wealth!

        "summary": "It was a busy week for mergers and acquisitions in the oil and gas industry. Hess (HES) shareholders approved plans to be acquired by competitor Chevron (CVX). A move that was first announced in October 2023. ConocoPhillips (COP) also reached an agreement to acquire Marathon Oil (MRO) in a $17.1 billion all-stock deal. These big energy deals signal a larger trend in the oil industry: a handful of larger companies gobbling up the lion share of the industry space. Will these M&A activities face regulatory scrutiny? Will these growing industry titans face antitrust enforcement? Here is what you need to know. Hess shareholders agreed to a $53 billion acquisition by Chevron, Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferre covering the shareholder vote reports: \"A Chevron spokesperson saying after this vote: 'We are pleased that a majority of Hess shareholders have voted to approve the merger. We anticipate moving the FTC regulatory process towards its conclusion in the coming weeks.'\" However, Chevron may not be out of the woods yet, as they face serious opposition from competitor ExxonMobil (XOM). The two oil companies are fighting for the rights over a lucrative oil reserve in the Guyana coast (bordering Venezuela). Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan summarizes: \"Now Exxon has about 45% share in that particular asset, Hess at 30%, and a China state-owned company owning 25%. What Exxon is saying is that its majority stake gives them the right to counter whatever Chevron would be offering for Hess's stake.\" With the Guyana coast oil reserve being the crown-jewel asset of this transaction between Chevron and Hess, Exxon's right of first refusal could kill the deal entirely. ConocoPhillips is in talks to acquire Marathon Oil for $17.1 billion in an all-stock-deal. Tortoise Portfolio Manager Rob Thummel explains: \"Marathon Oil actually has one of the highest free-cash flow yields in the oil & gas space. When you merge these assets together, what ConocoPhillips gets is some good assets across the Bakken in North Dakota, across the Permian and the Eagle Ford in Texas, but it get's a lot of free cash flow.\" ConocoPhillips merging with Marathon Oil is indicative of a larger trend in the oil & gas industry; smaller oil companies acknowledge that they cannot compete with their more powerful and resource-rich competitors. Alpine Saxon Wood's Chief Market Strategist Sarah Hunt elaborates: \"The reality on the ground is fossil fuels are going to be with us for a lot longer, but there has been a change in the way investors perceive them. I think this is all about consolidating into a smaller number of players in a very mature industry, that is looked at as something that is not going to last forever.\" The Dallas Federal Reserve surveyed industry executives in the oil & gas space in attempt to gauge the forecast for future M&A activities. Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferre reports: \"Overwhelmingly they anticipate more mergers in the next two years. As one analyst told Yahoo Finance nobody wants to be too small to compete with the big guys.\"  This article was written by Noah Chadwick",

Meanwhile, ConocoPhillips (COP) is gearing up to acquire Marathon Oil (MRO) in a massive $17.1 billion all-stock transaction. Joining Market Domination to discuss the outlook for the oil sector amid this consolidation wave are Alpine Saxon Woods Founding Partner Sarah Hunt and CFRA Research Energy Equity Analyst Stewart Glickman. Hunt highlights the entire industry \"is under a lot of pressure\" as it pivots toward alternative energy sources. \"I think this is all about consolidating into a smaller number of players, in a very mature industry, that is looked at as something that is not going to last forever,\" Hunt tells Yahoo Finance. Glickman, however, doesn't see the Conoco deal as \"transformative,\" suggesting the company is on the defensive. With the Permian Basin posing headwinds for oil output, Glickman argues that by acquiring Marathon, Conoco is decreasing its Permian exposure \u2014 ultimately benefiting the company. He adds, \"If you're going to grow at all, you're better off growing by acquisition than you are by throwing a lot of money into new cap-ex.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

The top ten companies on the inaugural list included industrial giants like General Motors (GM), U.S. Steel (X), Chrysler, and oil powerhouses such as Jersey Standard (now Exxon Mobil (XOM)), and Gulf Oil.

To gain insight into whether this trend can continue, Solomon Partners CEO Marc Cooper shares his outlook on dealmaking for the remainder of 2024. Cooper characterizes the current M&A environment as \"a tale of two cities.\" On one hand, he notes that \"strategic M&A is doing great,\" with companies continuing to engage in \"noteworthy transactions\" aimed at creating increased value. However, Cooper points out, \"the real issue is private equity.\" He explains that this segment of the market has not yet reached \"that equilibrium point\" between buyers' and sellers' expectations. \"There are an unprecedented number of assets owned by private equity that are slated for sale, but are not getting done because of price discrepancy.

Glickman described the print as \"disappointing,\" and downgraded the shares to a Hold from a Buy. Beyond the quarter, Chevron now faces a lengthy delay in its attempted acquisition of Hess (HES). Chevron saying in a securities filing that an arbitration case brought by rival ExxonMobil (XOM) could drag on well into 2025. Glickman noted that prolonged uncertainty was a factor in downgrading the stock, noting he and his team have \"thrown in the towel\" on the Chevron story. Conversely, ExxonMobil had a stellar quarter with a beat on its top and bottom line. The company's production securing a big boost from its recent acquisition of Pioneer.

ExxonMobile beat expectations on both revenue and profit, reporting revenue of $93.06 billion, surpassing estimates of $87.75 billion. Adjusted earnings also exceeded projections, coming in at $2.14 per share versus the expected $2.03. Chevron saw mixed results, topping revenue estimates with $51.18 billion against projections of $50.31 billion, while adjusted EPS fell short at $2.56, missing the estimated $2.93. Tortoise portfolio manager Brian Kessens joins Catalysts to discuss his outlook on each company following their respective reports. Kessens notes that Exxon beat their production estimates while also outperforming on their \"three larger horses that they're betting on\" for long-term growth. These include their legacy Permian position, the acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, and their Guyana assets. Kessens states he \"really like[s] what Exxon is doing.\" On the other hand, he points out that Chevron experienced \"unplanned downtime\" in their production this quarter, falling short on numerous international operations. With the Hess (HES) acquisition being a significant focus at Chevron, Kessens describes it as \"an overhang\" for the company. \"I think from a business perspective, their best [bet] is to keep their head down, fight through and execute on their existing business, and try to put the Hess acquisition to the side as they focus on that,\" he told Yahoo Finance.

Similarly, the oil and gas company also saw record production in Guyana, contributing to its second quarter earnings growth. Chief Financial Officer Kathryn Mikells joins Market Domination to discuss both of these operations and how they play into the overall outlook of the company. \"As we look at the combined now Pioneer-Exxon Mobil Permian operations, we see even more opportunities for synergies there which we're getting out in front of already. And so just as an example, Pioneer has a remote logistics operations that Exxon Mobil has now taken on and added into our remote wells and completions operations in order to drive more synergies across logistics and procurement. We are starting to utilize what is a very large water recycling infrastructure in the Midland Basin that Pioneer brings to the table,\" Mikells says of the merger. She notes that with Pioneer, Exxon has been able to further its commitment to reducing its environmental footprint and that there are more opportunities for synergies ahead. Meanwhile, Hess (HES) shareholders approved an acquisition by Chevron (CVX) despite a dispute over Exxon's claim of a right of first refusal over Hess's Guyana assets. Mikells explains that the company feels \"really good about the arbitration panel timeline,\" explaining that it is a situation that warrants \"people to take time in order to really inform all the data and all the circumstances to interpret the joint operating agreement.\" A hearing is slated toward the end of May in 2025, with a final ruling to come by September 2025. Mikells adds, \"if for some reason we were not successful in affirming the preemption that we have, our expectation would be that the Chevron-Hess transaction would move forward. But in the next breath, I would tell you we feel very good about our position in this arbitration being one of the parties that actually negotiated the agreement that's being discussed in the arbitration.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.",

While coming off record highs last year, Mikells notes that this year, price and margins have fallen back to the 10-year range, which she describes as \"consistent with a still pretty constructive market overall.\" \"The work the company has done to improve our underlying earnings power, that's put us in a really good place in terms of just the resiliency of that earnings power through any market environment,\" she adds. In its second quarter, ExxonMobil saw its earnings increase by nearly $1 billion from its last quarter, which Mikells believes \"reflects the decisions that we're making around our portfolio and investments and continuing to drive efficiency across our business.\" ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods announced that energy demand should rise 15% between 2024 and 2050, and Mikells expects 2024's demand to top the record-high demand seen in 2023. She notes that the demand is driven largely by countries addressing energy poverty, saying, \"having low-cost, reliable energy is one of the things that really drives economic growth and pulls people out of poverty.\" As that demand continues, she anticipates ExxonMobil's refining business to get a boost and the overall industry to address production capacities.

To explore the implications for the broader energy sector, Truist Securities Managing Director of Energy Neal Dingmann shares his insights on Market Domination. Dingmann observes a \"bit more risk-off\" sentiment within the energy sector, noting an increasing bearish attitude among investors towards oil. However, he cautions that if Middle Eastern tensions were to intensify, the impact on oil prices could be \"very quick and quite severe,\" potentially triggering an immediate 10 to 15% surge in prices. Despite this uncertainty, Dingmann advises investors to maintain their positions in energy stocks. \"To me, the reason to hold the group is it's hard to find a sector where you see better shareholder return in the form of bulk dividends and buybacks than you do in the energy stocks these days,\" adding that he is \"cautiously optimistic\" on the sector.

Exxon last year announced plans to extract lithium from the Smackover Formation, an underground deposit of salty water known as brine that stretches from Florida through Arkansas and into Texas, using at least one type of direct lithium extraction (DLE) technology.  Exxon and other oil companies such as Occidental Petroleum and Equinor are increasingly investing in lithium projects, partly due to their belief that extracting the metal from brine involves similar processes as petroleum extraction.",

In the energy sector, Cho highlights Chevron (CVX) and ExxonMobil (XOM), emphasizing that they \"really have valuation potential.\" She is closely watching companies like Boeing (BA), which she notes has \"taken a hit\" recently. In healthcare, she points to Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) as a stock that has \"been a favorite of ours for quite a while.\" Regarding Boeing, Cho believes the company has overcome significant challenges, including safety concerns and strikes. With these issues now \"in the rearview mirror,\" she sees the airplane manufacturer focusing on cleaning up its operations and addressing production challenges. \"I do feel that they're on the path to do that, and if they continue that, then that potentially could be very good for the stock,\" she added. Cho finds the biotech space particularly exciting, highlighting the increased innovation, especially in minimally invasive implants. \"These are things that are just revolutionary,\" she remarked. Cho anticipates significant growth in the energy sector driven by AI's increasing energy demands. As artificial intelligence expands, it will require \"an immense amount of energy,\" positioning the energy sector to benefit substantially from this trend.
