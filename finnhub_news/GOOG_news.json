MDB Capital president and chief market strategist Lou Basenese sits down in-studio with Seana Smith and Madison Mills for a conversation about where he expects market momentum to broaden out in the coming new year. \"The heavy concentration is the fact that if we look at the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500 (^GSPC), expectations are for their growth in earnings to accelerate significantly. So from about 4% this year to 13%,\" Basenese explains. \"So we need other names to pick up and carry the ball in 2025. And I think we're going to see that happen. The tech sector is obviously going to have the strongest growth, but we need to see everyone else participating.\" Basenese goes on to comment about where bitcoin (BTC-USD), the volatility index (^VIX), and even the Federal Reserve fit into market expectations.

He adds that Trump's second term will likely lead to a shift in the US government's attitude toward AI. The Biden administration's \"main approach to artificial intelligence was to say, 'This is an area where we ought to tread carefully, put up guardrails, and focus on safety,'\" Kovacevic says. \"What I think you are going to see with Trump is a pivot from safety to really [seeing] AI as an economic asset for the United States, a national asset for the United States, where we should go out and beat other countries, particularly China in AI.\" Watch the video above to hear more about the expected tech landscape in 2025, including the possible TikTok ban, Big Tech execs courting Trump, Musk's role in the US government, and more.

        "summary": "The Futurum Group CEO Daniel Newman shares insights on artificial intelligence (AI) agents' growing impact heading into 2025 on Market Domination. Newman projects that AI agents represent a $4 trillion annual global market opportunity over the next five years, describing it as \"a massive opportunity\" for companies. He explains that these AI solutions can provide organizations with thousands of \"people-like workers\" to handle automated tasks. \"Agentic use cases are being used to help drive productivity, but also ... to create more efficient economics for enterprises,\" he tells Yahoo Finance. According to Newman, AI agents are gaining traction because they enable companies to start \"unlocking the value of their enterprise data to create productivity growth.\" He predicts that \"we're going to see it embedded in every software stack.\" When discussing Big Tech's prospects under a new Trump administration, Newman expresses optimism: \"I think he's going to want to see these companies remain prosperous.\" He also anticipates increased merger-and-acquisition activity in the sector throughout the coming year.

His top pick for 2025 and large-cap stocks, in fact, is rideshare giant Uber Technologies (UBER). \"When we looked at Uber we see a couple of things: Number one, an outsized risk reward. Our fair value is $96... with we believe not much downside. The stock also has gotten caught up in a lot of debates in the last few months... [including] the debate around Waymo and what will happen to autonomous vehicles over the next three, five, seven, ten years,\" Sheridan tells Catalyst hosts Seana Smith\u00a0and\u00a0Brian Sozzi. Sheridan also shares his favorable outlook on Magnificent Seven players Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta Platforms (META). \u201cAmazon, among those three, probably has the most upside. We believe Amazon still has exposure to the widest collection of the secular themes\u00a0you want exposure to in the digital economy,\u201d Sheridan says. \u201cMedia consumption habits, shopping, cloud computing, AI \u2014 these are all themes you want a lot of exposure to.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts here.
